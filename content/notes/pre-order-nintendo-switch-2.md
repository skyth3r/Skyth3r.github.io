Two weeks ago, I managed to pre-order a [Nintendo Switch 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1-W7ZV0RNw)!

When pre-orders opened, I didn't really think of putting in an order, until a week later when I changed my mind.

I realised I was going to get a bit of FOMO if I didn't get it, plus there was a decent saving to be made if I was to get the bundle that included a digital copy of [Mario Kart World](https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/mario-kart-world-70010000096802).

I love the original Nintendo Switch and the fact that the entire library of Switch 1 games is going to be compatible with the Switch 2 (with some games getting an upgrade) was another reason I wanted to pre-order the console.

I never got around to completing Pokemon Violet or Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, so I might just pick those back up after getting the new console.

I'm also looking forward to getting Pokemon: Legends Z-A when that launches.
