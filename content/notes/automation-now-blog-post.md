Around the start of this year, I put together a [Go script to automatically update my now page](https://github.com/skyth3r/automate-now).

I [posted a note](/notes/automating-now) about it on my website and planned to eventually do a write up on how I did it.

Last friday, I finally posted the deep dive on my developer website under the title [Automating my /now page](https://akashgoswami.dev/posts/automating-my-now-page/) and decided to cross post it to a few places, including [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41264716#41270859).

This was my first time posting something I'd written on Hacker News, so I was surprised to find out that I ended up hitting the front page of Hacker News as the third post in the list.

This ended up leading to **over 9,000 people clicking through to my post** ðŸ¤¯

Overall the feedback was quite positive and I even received a few encouraging comments including a little message from Derek Sivers (the person behind the [nownownow website](https://nownownow.com/)).
