Readwise Reader is my default 'read later' app now. The issue I've always had with read it later apps, is that I'll save a bunch of things to them, and then never get back around to reading anything I've saved. I haven't improved on that since using Readwise Reader. Since I've started using it I have just over 1,000 articles split between the Inbox and Later tabs.

In an attempt to start organising and getting rid of articles I don't need, I've started making using of document tags to categorise what I have saved.

There's just one small problem...

A lot of these articles I've saved in the past have no tags on them 🙃

So I realised I needed to be able to search and find all the items I had with no tags on them. It wasn't super straight forward but it turns out that there's a guide on creating [new views with filters](https://readwise.notion.site/Reader-Filtering-Guide-d4b249df2eaa492283099ec2a3551640). Using this guide I ended up creating a new view 'Untagged'.

Even with the guide it was still a bit tricky, so here's how I created that view within the web app 👇🏽

1. Click 'Manage Views' in the left menu bar
2. Click 'Add filtered view' in the top right of the page
3. Enter `has__not:tags` as the query to find all items without a document tag
4. Click 'Save View'
5. Type in a name for the view and hit enter

Your newly created view should now appear in the left side menu bar 🎉

Using the guide and these steps you can now create filtered views to view items in your app with easy. Hope that helps (because part of me wished I found a guide like this earlier).
