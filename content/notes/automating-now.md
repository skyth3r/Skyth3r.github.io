A quick little website update.

My [now](/now) page on this website is automatically updated daily ðŸŽ‰

The travel and media sections are now updated daily with the lastest places I've been and the lastest things I've watched, read and played as well! 

The idea to automate my now page comes from seeing other folks trying to do the same, but I was mainly inspired by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/blog/automating-my-now-page/) and [Sophie Koonin](https://localghost.dev/blog/everything-should-have-an-api-adventures-in-trying-to-automate-stuff/).

This data is obtained from a few different sources. If you want to know more about how it works, you can checkout the Go script I wrote [here on GitHub](https://github.com/Skyth3r/automate-now).

I plan on putting a small guide together on how to use it to automate your own now page as well as a detailed deep dive post to explain how I got it all working and what some of the challenges were with this project soon.

**Update:** I got around to writing the post on how I did this using a Go and GitHub Actions. You can read more about [how I automated my now page here](https://akashgoswami.dev/posts/automating-my-now-page/).
