**Note** - Arc seems to have removed this feature from the browser now. I'm not sure when they are bringing it back.

One of the features I've always liked in Apple's Safari web browser is the [Safari Reader mode](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri32632/mac), which removes ads, navigation or other distracting elements from a web page.

This works perfectly for me on iOS but on my laptop, I mainly use Google Chrome and Arc for my web browsing. 

Chrome has a reader type view hidden under `chrome://flags` and by then searching for 'reading mode' but it's still a bit complicated to enable and doesn't provide the same view as Safari's web browser. 

It turns out, [Arc for macOS](https://arc.net/) has a hidden reader mode that can be enabled on a web page by pressing the `option + command + r` keys together which is much more similar to Safari's reader mode.

***Note*** - Arc's reader mode is still in beta but does a great job regardless
