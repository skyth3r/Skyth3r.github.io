This year, I was looking forward to upgrading my gaming PC, but hardware costs have been skyrocketing in the last few months. The RAM industry has essentially been [bought out by AI data centres](https://www.trustedreviews.com/explainer/ram-prices-2026). There was even a sad/funny story about how [Samsung (Semiconductor) refused to sell RAM to Samsung (Electronics) because of RAM prices](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998935/ram-is-so-expensive-samsung-wont-even-sell-it-to-samsung.html).

Part of me wanted to push ahead, thinking this was going to be a temporary spike in one component category, but then I saw news that Nvidia GPUs were likely also going to suffer for a supply shortage as, which in turn will lead to more expensive graphics cards. On top of that, to add insult to injury, hard drive prices are also starting to tick upwards now, all driven by the constant and growing needs of the AI industry.

Don't get me wrong, I've used AI in my day-to-day life, and for coding, at least have found it very helpful. I don't find a lot of use in a lot of the other types of generative AI right now. Seeing prices tick up like this across the hardware industry to feed an AI industry that provides mixed results is not something I'm happy with.

Given these sharp price increases and the fact that I already have a pretty good PC build (Nvidia 3080 FE, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 2TB M2 SSD). I’m likely only going to be making a modest upgrade in RAM this year instead of looking to build an entirely new PC.

The supply chain shock has made me thankful to have bought a mini PC for my homelab just before these price increases. I managed to get a Beelink with a 13th Gen Intel Alder Lake-N150, 16GB RAM and a 1TB SSD for £228 towards the end of October last year. Looking back at the same listing now, I can see that the price is now closer to £300 for the same machine - An increase of 31.6%!

I'm not sure when or even if prices will drop, but in the meantime, I have a lot of other meaningful projects to work on in the meantime. For gaming, I still have both my current gaming PC and a Nintendo Switch 2, but I'll likely be looking to get either a Steam Deck or a Steam Machine later this year instead of building a new PC.
