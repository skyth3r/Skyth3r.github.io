Spotify is currently how I consume and discover new music. I've been a paying member for some time, but I've been avoiding the price hikes in the monthly cost using a trick I found a few years ago. 

This trick is to simply pay for Spotify annually instead of monthly using a 12 month gift card, and in the process I end up saving about Â£45 a year. 

How does it work?

Currently, the 'Individual' plan of Spotify Premium costs Â£11.99 a month. Over a year, this ends up being Â£144 a year.

I found that the annual 12 month Spotify gift card costs about Â£99, so over 12 months the monthly price ends up being Â£8.25 a month.

I was told that this no longer worked, however my 12 month subscription was due to end this month, so I ended up finding the same gift card online, redeemed it to my account and was pleased to see that I was granted an extra 12 month of premium without any issues. 

Given the savings, I think it's definitely worth paying for a year upfron (if you can afford it of course) if you know you are going to stick to Spotify for the next 12 months.

You can pick up one of these Spotify gift cards from either [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spotify-Premium-Gift-Card-Delivered/dp/B085FMJKL8) or [Currys](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/spotify-premium-digital-gift-card-12-months-10253841.html).

Just remember - This only works on the Individual plan and the gift cards are meant to be used for UK accounts only.

Happy streaming ðŸŽµ
