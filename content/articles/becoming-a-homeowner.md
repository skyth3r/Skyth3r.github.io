It’s the end of the year, and I have a bit of a confession to make. I haven't put as much time as I wanted to towards writing posts for my websites or made many improvements to them over the last year.

I’ve been incredibly busy because **I bought a house earlier this year** 🎉

It’s taken an incredibly long time to get here (10 years, specifically), which involved a lot of planning, saving, and yes…a spreadsheet, but it all paid off when I got the keys to my new home a few months ago.

I realise I’m in quite a fortunate position - There are not many people I know who would be in a position to solo buy a house in the city of London with zero financial support from family (or friends). Luck has also likely played a massive part in being able to accomplish this.

The process of getting my first property has taken the better part of my year, so I’ve not had as much time for other areas of my life. Thankfully, my house purchase process went quite smoothly (and fairly quickly, too), and I managed to move in without any issues.

What’s actually taken up most of my time after that is the admin and logitics of actually furnishing out the place after I moved in. Since becoming a homeowner, I’ve realised that there are many side projects I want to work on to make the house feel more homely.

My focus is going to be on the house over the next year, but I’m hoping to share updates on some of the projects I’ve started working on. So far, I’ve set up my first home lab and got [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) up and running, and I’m in the process of getting a 3D printer as well.

There are several bits of DIY and plain old home improvements that need to be made as well.

Overall, I’m happy with how far I’ve managed to come this year and I'm looking forward to what the next year brings 💪🏽
