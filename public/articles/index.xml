      <title>Buying a bike</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/buying-a-bike/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/buying-a-bike/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I debated about getting a new bicycle after 10 years of not owning a bike, but after doing some cycling in Amsterdam while away on &lt;a href=&#34;https://akashgoswami.com/articles/sabbatical-leave-part-1/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;sabbatical&lt;/a&gt;, I finally bought a bike last summer and it’s been my favourite purchase I’ve made in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-cycle&#34;&gt;Why I cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are few reasons I’ve started cycling again. The first is just that I just really enjoy cycling. I had a mountain bike growing up but at some point, I ended up leaving my bike out in the rain for too long and it ended up rusting away. It’s been over 10 years since I’ve owned a bike, so I thought now would be a great time to get back into cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s something freeing about being able to get around quicker than walking while also (usually) being able to skip the massive traffic jams. Cycling more often also means I’m less reliant on needing to drive a car for short trips. It seems a bit inefficient driving a 4 seater car when I’m usually only driving short trips by myself most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also work in central London, and driving to work isn’t really an option (there’s a £25 congestion charge plus parking is hard to find and expensive). The quickest way to my workplace is via the central line, which quickly feels hellish in the summer given there’s no air conditioning in the carriages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that while a journey via train takes somewhere around 50 minutes, I checked how long it would take me to cycle to work and found that it would only take an extra 10 minutes compared to commuting by train and my workplace offers secure bike parking. I ended up trialing commuting to work via bike once last summer and found myself enjoying the journey a lot more than sitting on a hot tube carriage. Given the length of the journey (11 miles), I found myself cycling to work about 1-2 times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this has been great because it means I’ve been able to save a little bit of money by cycling instead of taking the tube, exploring more of my local neighbourhoods (making note of nice spots to check out later) and alternative routes to work, all while also getting a good workout in the process. I’m now at the stage where every time I do get the tube to work, I wonder why I didn’t just cycle instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have of course been challenges when it comes to cycling. The main problem is how unviable cycling an hour in the cold in the winter is. For that reason, I ended up taking a break from cycling during the colder months and picked it back up this year when the weather finally started to get a bit warmer. Traffic in more central parts of London can also be a bit challenging. I’ve witnessed several near crashes between other cyclists and cars so I tend to avoid cars when and where possible by taking cycling routes through parks and quiet streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to cycling to work, I’ve also been taking longer cycling trips over the weekend to explore other parts of the city, learn new routes and get better at cycling longer distances. I went from being able to cycle 25-30 miles (with breaks of course) to now being able to cycle 45 miles in one trip! Eventually, I’ll work my way up to doing a 60-mile trip so I can attempt to cycle from London to Brighton and then work my way up to being able to do a multi-day cycling trip from London to Amsterdam one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-bike&#34;&gt;My bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike I ended up getting is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.halfords.com/bikes/hybrid-bikes/carrera-crossfire-2-mens-hybrid-bike-2020---black---s-m-l-frames-345886.html&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Carrera Crossfire 2&lt;/a&gt;. Originally I was considering getting it under my workplace’s cycle2work scheme (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;cyclescheme&lt;/a&gt;) from Halfords but it turned out Halfords wasn’t a supported retailer for the cycle scheme (which also lead to me discovering that there was way more than one cycle2work scheme in the UK 😅).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I found the same bike on Facebook Marketplace and managed to get a used one (yet still in great condition) for just £150.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needed some repairs, some of which I had taken care of at a bike shop while others I ended up taking as a chance to learn how to do my own bike repairs (I managed to replace my first tyre all by myself recently!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I was planning on only using this bike for commuting but I ended up enjoying cycling so much that I started cycling more often on the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally I was planning on converting this bike into an e-bike using an electric bike conversion kit, as my cycling commute to work was a bit longer than most cycling commutes other colleagues have (20 mins vs my 1 hour journey) and because there are some tough hills I need tackle on my cycle commute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided against it in favour of having a bike I could commute to work on and also use for leisure on the weekends. I am however considering getting an electric bike to use in addition to this bike. I’m still looking into a few options for that but I’m hoping I’ll have picked something before the end of the summer this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tips-for-getting-into-cycling&#34;&gt;Tips for getting into cycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re considering getting a bike here are a few things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a helmet! Even if your journey is a short one, wear a helmet to be safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Facebook Marketplace or Gumtree for a used bike first. It’s cheaper and if you end up deciding not to commit to cycling, the upfront costs are a lot lower (and you can sell the bike onwards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are considering getting a new bike check if you can buy it via your workplace cycle2work scheme. You can end up saving some money this way compared to buying it new outside of a cycle2work scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a D-lock with at least a Sold Secure Gold rating (and if you plan on cycling a lot and parking your bike consider getting 2 locks for your bike)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re planning on cycling to work, check if your workplace offers secure cycling parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Initial thoughts on Robinhood UK</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood-uk/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 22:55:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood-uk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/gb/en/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, a US-based stock trading app, went &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cityam.com/robinhood-launches-to-uk-customers/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;live in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. As someone who is very much interested in investing and having tried out other app-based investment platforms in the past, I thought it would be a good idea to share my thoughts on the platform and if it’s worth using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, I had just watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://letterboxd.com/film/dumb-money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Dumb Money&lt;/a&gt;, covering the GameStop sage in 2021 on a flight back from South Africa yesterday so Robinhood’s UK launch is a well-timed surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-website&#34;&gt;The website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first have a look at Robinhood’s website for its UK launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hero-section&#34;&gt;The hero section&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon the first visit to the UK Robinhood website, you’re greeted by a well-designed hero image of London, featuring Big Ben, the river Thames and a glimpse of the London Eye on the right. The main title features Robinhood’s key promised feature ‘Trade US stocks without commission or FX fees’.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/hero.png&#34; alt=&#34;Robinhood UK website, hero section&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-costs&#34;&gt;Other Costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath that is a hyperlink stating ‘Other costs apply’ and that capital is at risk. Pretty standard for a stock trading platform. Clicking the ‘Other costs apply’ link takes you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHUK_Fee_Schedule.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;a PDF that lists a few fees Robinhood does charge&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these fees are listed as $0 except for the Regulatory Trading Fees section and a single fee/rate under the Margin section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two fees under Regulatory Trading Fees are a regulatory fee of $8.00 per $1,000,000 of principal (sells only), rounded up to the nearest penny and a trading activity fee of $0.000166 per share (sells only), rounded up to the nearest penny and no greater than $8.30. These fees are set by US law and regulation outside of Robinhood’s control and there are similar fees when you buy UK stocks. Additionally, there are some small disclaimers for each of these fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;regulatory-trading-fees&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Trading Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the regulatory fee, Robinhood doesn’t pass this fee on to you for sales with a notional value of $500 or less. For the trading activity fee, the limit on this fee is based on the execution of your order, which can occur in parts. Robinhood doesn’t pass this fee on to you for sales of 50 shares or less. Awesome news for people just getting into investing and those who are making smaller and infrequent trades via Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;margin-fees&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margin Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Margin section is a single fee, a ‘Standard Margin Rate’ of 12%. I don’t personally do any margin trading, but I imagine this rate has to do with the interest rate charged for money borrowed for margin trading on Robinhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a small disclaimer stating that the ‘Margin interest rate shown is as of 26/7/2023 and is calculated by adding 6.5% to the upper bound of the Target Federal Funds Rate which is set by the Federal Reserve, and is subject to change. The formula used to calculate the margin interest rate is subject to change at Robinhood’s discretion.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty standard stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;exchange-rate-fees&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchange Rate Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one isn’t listed on the PDF but rather further down the home page under the comparison, table Robinhood has listed. Since Robinhood offers stock trading in US stocks, and most UK investors will not have access to a USD funding source, there’s going to be a need to convert pounds to dollars and vice versa.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/third-party-cost.png&#34; alt=&#34;Third party cost disclaimer under comparison table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood holds funds in USD and thus charges a 0.03% ‘third party cost’ (translation - fee by third party exchange provider) that will be included in the exchange rate. Technically this would mean that Robinhood has an FX fee, but this fee goes to the third-party exchange company that exchanges your money from pounds to USD as a service fee and that this is not something Robinhood themselves control or profit from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Trading212 charges a 0.15% currency conversion rate fee when buying shares that require a currency conversion (e.g. buying US stocks in USD via an account that holds funds in GBP). Robinhood’s fee is 80% lower in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;featured-benefits&#34;&gt;Featured benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrolling down the main website, we can see the top 4 features Robinhood offers; trading stocks with no commission and FX fees, 5% interest on cash holdings, getting a free stock to get started and being able to trade stocks 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;trading-us-stocks&#34;&gt;Trading US Stocks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty self-explanatory and is the main feature of several other trading platforms. It will be interesting to see the stocks Robinhood offers compared to trading platforms, but now Robinhood boasts that it will be possible to purchase shares in over 6,000 companies listed on US stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;interest-on-cash&#34;&gt;Interest (on cash)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood currently offers 5% interest on cash held in their USD account. This is a rate that is only offered to Robinhood Gold members (which costs $5 a month), while regular Robinhood US investors earn 1.5% on cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing this, the current base rate from the Bank of England is 5.25%. Most banks trying to acquire new deposits will offer a rate on instant access savings accounts that is just below the base rate in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood is doing the same thing here but since the money is held in a USD account, the interest being earned comes from the US Fed interest rate which currently sits at 5.50%, a little higher than the base rate from the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Robinhood is making use of a partner bank network made up of 12 banks to offer a combined FDIC insurance coverage of 2.25 million USD. This isn’t mentioned on the UK website but if you check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;FAQ section for Robinhood Gold&lt;/a&gt; on the US website, it mentions this and how it works
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/gold-fdic-insureance.png&#34; alt=&#34;Robinhood US Gold, Q - How can you give 9x the FDIC insurance of a standard bank s $250K? A - That&amp;rsquo;s easy&amp;hellip;we&amp;rsquo;ve got 12 partner banks so you can enjoy a combined coverage of up to $2.25 million FDIC insurance across all of them.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just bear in mind that, if you have any accounts with any of these partner banks then the $250,000 FDIC insurance (per partner bank) is shared across all accounts to hold with this partner bank, but it is highly unlikely that this will apply to the majority of UK investors who will not have a USD checking account before signing up to Robinhood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protects up to £85,000 does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; apply to this account since it is not a UK trading account (technically).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the 0.03% deposit and withdrawal ‘third party cost’ fee, this could make Robinhood a competitive savings account provider, although the FAQs on Robinhood Gold also mention that withdrawals can take up to 4-5 days (or pay a 1.5% fee for an instant withdrawal) but I didn’t see this mentioned anywhere on the UK website.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/withdrawals.png&#34; alt=&#34;Robinhood US Gold, Q - Is it hard to withdraw my cash? How long does it take to get it out? A - It&amp;rsquo;s your money, you can access your money whenever you want. Bank transfers can take up to 4-5 days or you can choose the instant withdrawal option for a 1.5% fee.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;free-stocks&#34;&gt;Free stocks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite normal for trading platforms to offer a free share if you’ve been referred to an account via a refer-a-friend program (which was funnily enough made popular by Robinhood in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, also claims to offer a free fractional share when you sign up to Robinhood in addition to the Refer a Friend program (normally there are no free shares given if you do not sign up via a referral link with other investment platforms).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terms state that you can be offered between $7-$175 if you sign up and fund your account. They also state that 96% of participants will receive a cash value of $7 to $8 (net), and provide a handy table to see your probability of what the value of your free share will be.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/reward-probability.png&#34; alt=&#34;Reward probability table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll be able to apply this cash to purchase a share from 22 stocks (selected by choosing the 2 largest S&amp;amp;P 500 companies within the top 11 sectors based on market cap).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;24-hour-trading-on-weekdays&#34;&gt;24-hour trading (on weekdays)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood also boasts that you can trade 24 hours, 5 days a week with a disclaimer that additional risks apply to trades made outside of regular market hours. A nice feature but personally I stick to making all my investment trading during regular market hours so this isn’t something I’m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pricing-and-comparison&#34;&gt;Pricing and comparison&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the pricing and comparison table with other UK brokerages, I won’t go into too much detail here but I will say, that the comparison table includes Freetrade but purposely excludes &lt;a href=&#34;https://trading212.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Trading212&lt;/a&gt;, which also has zero commission fees, a small 0.15% FX fee on currency conversions, 5.2% interest on cash and 24/5 trading. The table here isn’t lying, but it’s clear they’ve omitted their true competitor from this table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, Robinhood has a great page breaking down &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/gb/en/price/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;how its fees work&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m surprised this was not linked in the hero section and instead a PDF file was chosen to be linked to the ‘Other costs apply’ text (might be something to do with regulation stuff).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice bonus on this page, is that there is &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/gb/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;a link to another page that explains how Robinhood makes money&lt;/a&gt;. I would give it a read if you were curious. Seems pretty normal for a commission-free trading platform in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;protection-commitments&#34;&gt;Protection commitments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to skip over the interest on cash section since we’ve already covered it and the fractional shares call out since this is a pretty standard feature across trading apps now. Instead, let’s look at Robinhood’s ‘Protection commitments’. This is also standard across most trading platforms now. Password hashing and encryption and used as standard and they also offer two-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that a strong and unique password should be used in combination with two-factor authentication. There were incidents in the past where Robinhood US accounts were hacked and drained due to password reuse (it’s up to investors to set a unique password) and not enabling two-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/banking/robinhood-20-million-settlement-who-is-eligible-for-money/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Robinhood faced a 20 million dollar class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; where around 40,000 customers said their accounts had been hacked. They also faced &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-announces-data-security-incident-update/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;a data breach where the data of 7 million investors were stolen&lt;/a&gt; via a social engineering attack on a customer support employee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood’s security practices seem to have gotten a lot better since then. Robinhood claims to cover 100% of direct losses due to unauthorised account activity that is not &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; fault (this is legal speak for, you better use a unique password and enable two-factor authentication).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprised me was that Robinhood offered me the ability to create a passkey for accessing my Robinhood account after I had created it. A nice (and secure) addition that gets a thumbs-up from me.
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/robinhood-passkey.png&#34; alt=&#34;Robinhood passkey creation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below the protection commitments section is the final section on the home page, &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.robinhood.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Robinhood Learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood Learn offers a large assortment of articles to learn more about the various parts of investing. If you’re new to investing, this is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I would skip is the option trading section. I don’t think this is relevant for most investors as there’s a higher risk of losing your money with options trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;signing-up-via-the-app&#34;&gt;Signing up (via the app)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to sign up for a Robinhood UK account and noticed a few things during the signup flow I thought were worth mentioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-selected-margin-account-signup&#34;&gt;Pre-selected Margin Account Signup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the signup flow is pretty standard (and well-designed in my opinion), but there was one part on the final step of creating the account that alarmed me. On the final part of the Brokerage account application page, I noticed that a box was preselected, ‘Robinhood Margin Account Agreement’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/margin-account.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pre-selected margin account&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving this option ticked would create a margin account instead of a ‘Non-Margin account’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s pretty sneaky having this option pre-selected without really explaining the risks that come with a margin trading account. There are large risks that come with margin trading and in addition to that Robinhood also charges that 12% margin rate they mentioned in their ‘other costs’ if you end up using this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that I was right to be alarmed by this because, on the same day, Robinhood announced it was going live in the UK, they ended up &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reuters.com/technology/trading-app-robinhood-drops-margin-investing-uk-launch-2024-03-19/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;pausing their plans to lend to UK-based customers pending talks with regulators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin trading is not something that is typically offered to UK investors but Robinhood would have been allowed to offer this feature due to some type of “regulatory exemption” but it’s not clear what that exemption is exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion - stay away from margin trading. Investing already comes with risk, so why add more unnecessary risk, especially if you are a new investor? I ended up just unchecking the box and continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;funding&#34;&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding the account was pretty easy. This is handled by open banking via Truelayer. No issues here and worked as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;identity-verification&#34;&gt;Identity Verification&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve signed up for dozens of fintech apps and they all follow a similar identification verification process. Take a photo of your ID and take a video or photo of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one part of Robinhood’s process that threw me off, however…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood asked me for a photo of my ‘tax document’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/tax-document.png&#34; alt=&#34;tax document&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investment platforms will ask for a NIN (National Insurance number) but Robinhood also wanted a colour photo of a paper copy of either a payslip, P45 or P60. This is the first time I’ve ever been asked for this. Thankfully I was able to print out a copy fairly quickly and continue with the application process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;accessing-the-app&#34;&gt;Accessing the app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting that, my account application is still in review, but in the meantime, I have been granted access to other parts of the app. Right now I’m able to view stocks in the app and read the latest news on various stocks as well. All that’s left now is for my account to be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;will-i-use-robinhood-going-forward&#34;&gt;Will I use Robinhood going forward?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Robinhood shows a lot of promise, I likely wouldn’t be using it in the future for investing. There are two key reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-isa-offering&#34;&gt;No ISA offering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no Stocks and Shares ISA offering, meaning there is no way to make gains on investment via Robinhood in a tax-efficient manner. I would rather focus on investing via a Stocks and Shares ISA which allows for tax-free gains. Currently, the amount you can put into ISAs in a single tax year is £20,000 a year (or about £1,666 a month). Most people never fully max out their ISA allowance every tax year and they would likely be better off focusing on doing that before looking into general investment accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if Robinhood only plans to offer accounts in USD then they will never be allowed to offer a stocks and shares ISA as HMRC rules do not allow you to hold foreign currency within an ISA (this is the same case for other apps such as Trading212 which offers a stocks and shares ISA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-etfs&#34;&gt;No ETFs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Robinhood focuses on the US stock market, it offers US-listed ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). Currently, under local and European regulations, it’s not possible to buy US-listed ETFs in the UK, which leaves investors with only being able to buy shares in single stocks (a lot riskier than buying an ETF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would hope Robinhood offers a localised ETF equivalent offerings similar to their competitors in the UK but given the large focus being buying and selling US stocks and the account being held in USD I don’t think this will happen any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall while Robinhood’s offering is unique and competitive in terms of fees compared to other brokerages in the UK. I think it makes more sense to focus on filling up a Stocks and Shares ISA for tax efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would only consider looking into a Robinhood account after fully utilising my ISA allowance first. I’m more of a long term passive investor, and I don’t think Robinhood is well suited for passive investors that are looking to solely focus on buying ETFs in a tax efficient investment account. There are other platforms that are better suited for passive investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just my opinion. Remember, none of this is financial advice. I just wanted to share some initial thoughts on Robinhood’s launch in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Houston, we have notes!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/adding-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 09:42:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/adding-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the articles, I’ve decided to add a notes section to the website now. There are times when I wanted to write a short piece about something but it didn’t feel right to put it in the articles section of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just want to…note something down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hence the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes&#34; &gt;notes section&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-notes-meant-to-be&#34;&gt;What are notes meant to be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes will be short pieces of writing. Most likely a couple of lines long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ll basically be my equivalent of a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a note ends up getting too long, I might decide to nudge it over to the articles section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;notes-rss-feed&#34;&gt;Notes RSS feed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/articles/building-websites-with-hugo&#34; &gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a new RSS feed is auto-magically generated for notes.
If you want to subscribe to it, here’s the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/notes/index.xml&#34; &gt;notes RSS feed link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DRM free books</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/removing-drm-from-kindle-books/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/removing-drm-from-kindle-books/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy reading books on my Kindle. I also buy most of my digital books via Amazon. I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@bjax_/a-tale-of-unwanted-disruption-my-week-without-amazon-df1074e3818b&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;an engineer had his Amazon account suspended&lt;/a&gt; due to a delivery driver&amp;rsquo;s false claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. I’ve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon. Losing access would mean losing the majority of my digital library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid such a situation, I decided it was time to make a copy of the digital eBooks I purchased from Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article covers how I removed the DRM from my Kindle ebooks so I can read my books on any device without needing to use a Kindle app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going further, I’ll answer some questions some folks might have 👇🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quick-frequently-asked-questions-faq&#34;&gt;Quick Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is DRM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It’s a type of tech used to control and manage access to copyrighted content. Its main purpose is to prevent content from being shared with those that did not pay for it and to also prevent the content from being modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What issues does it pose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While DRM is used to prevent piracy, it can cause issues for legitimate users as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say you bought a video game that comes with some DRM that checks you own the game by contacting the game publisher’s server before you can play the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine if the game publisher went out of business and with that, the server used for the DRM check goes offline with it. Now you’re in a situation where you’ve paid for a video game but you can no longer access it due to the DRM server going offline (Also what if you just wanted to play the game offline/without an internet connection?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital books from Amazon, are only intended to be read on Kindle devices and via the Kindle app using your Amazon account. If you lost access to your Amazon account for any reason, you would essentially lose access to the books you bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should you care about removing DRM from your eBooks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s simple. Not having DRM on your eBooks means you can read them on any device using any app you want without having to worry about losing access to your books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it illegal to remove DRM from your digital items?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Just don’t distribute the DRM-free books you have as that would be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There a several guides online that explain how to do this, I initially followed those methods but I got some errors when following these guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I’ve listed the steps that worked for me. You might find that this exact approach might not work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need a Kindle eReader or the Kindle app on your machine. I personally used my Kindle eReader for this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note - I use MacOS so these steps will be MacOS specific but the steps are similar if you are using a different operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;steps&#34;&gt;Steps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First download &lt;a href=&#34;https://calibre-ebook.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a free open source e-book manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have Calibre installed, you’ll need to download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/releases&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;NoDRM plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the settings/preferences menu within Calibre and then click plug-ins under ‘Advanced’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the ‘Load plug-in from file’ option and then select the noDRM zip file you downloaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your Kindle’s serial number from your Kindle device. You can find it under Settings &amp;gt; Device options &amp;gt; Device info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the plug-in menu in Calibre, select the NoDRM plug-in (under the file type sub-heading) and click ‘Customise plug-in’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select ‘Kindle eInk ebooks’, click the green plus icon and enter your Kindle serial number and then click ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to the plug-ins menu, click ‘Get new plug-ins’ and then install the ‘KFX Input’ plug-in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the Amazon website and then select the ‘Manage Your Content and Devices’ under your account menu and then click ‘Books’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the eBook you want to download and then select more actions &amp;gt; download and transfer via USB to download the eBook (Note - the file extension should be ‘AZW3’. I wasn’t able to get the ‘AFX’ file extension decryption/DRM removal working)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag and drop the eBook into the Calibre and then select ‘Convert Book” and then convert the book into whatever format you like (I usually go with ePub) and your eBook should have the DRM removed from it now 🎉&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re able to remove DRM from your Kindle books you can read them on any device you like! If you want a Kindle like e-reader without having to buy a Kindle, you might want to consider a &lt;a href=&#34;https://pocketbook.ch/en-ch&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Pocketbook&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-to-buy-ebooks-going-forward&#34;&gt;Where to buy eBooks going forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can of course still buy your eBooks from Amazon, but it might be worth exploring what other options exist that allow you to get DRM free books way more easily. One of my favourites is a website called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hive.co.uk/eBooks&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Hive&lt;/a&gt; which sells eBooks in ePub and PDF formats by default and most books are similarly priced to their Amazon counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s everything you should need to build a DRM-free digital library. All that’s left to do is to back up your eBooks somewhere (like a digital cloud provider) so you can always keep a copy of the books you bought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047875211730430527/Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Mockup&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Article header image by Vyshnav Gangadharan under CC 4.0 license&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sabbatical Leave (part 1)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/sabbatical-leave-part-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 08:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/sabbatical-leave-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took 9 weeks off work. Of those 9 weeks, I spent 8 travelling. This is a summary of how I found my time off and what I did, things I learnt from my first long-term travel trip and my favourite highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-sabbatical-leave&#34;&gt;What is sabbatical leave?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick 101 - sabbatical leave is an extended period of time away from work. Common reasons for taking sabbatical leave are to pursue interests outside of work; such as travelling, studying, volunteering or even just to take a break to just rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-i-get-my-sabbatical-leave&#34;&gt;How did I get my sabbatical leave?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work at a bank called &lt;a href=&#34;https://monzo.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Monzo&lt;/a&gt; and about a year ago they introduced a new benefit. 3 months of paid sabbatical leave for those that had been at the company for 4 years. It just happens so that I was months away from hitting my 4 year work anniversary at the time of this announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I did the logical thing and started planning how I would spend these 3 months away from work right away. In the end, I’ve taken 9 weeks of sabbatical leave this year, with plans of using the remaining next year for another trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;terms-and-conditions&#34;&gt;Terms and Conditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the catch? It almost sounds too good to be true right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, there was nothing that was of any concern. There were only two conditions I had to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was that for the amount of time, I took as sabbatical leave, I needed to give double the length of that as my notice for taking the leave. Since I took 9 weeks off, I had to give 18 weeks of notice before taking the time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other condition was that you’re required to keep working for the company for at least 6 months after taking sabbatical leave or I&amp;rsquo;d have to pay it back. Sounds pretty reasonable to me. I&amp;rsquo;m not planning on quitting anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-did-i-do-during-my-sabbatical&#34;&gt;What did I do during my sabbatical?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was really conflicted about what to do with my time off. Part of me really wanted to travel and another part of me wanted to stay at home and work on several projects I just never found the time for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided to prioritise travelling and also make use of the credit card points/air miles I’d been saving up for the last 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of planning, I ended up visiting 6 countries on my trip; The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. I went slowly through these countries to take the time to explore without feeling like I didn’t have enough time to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally my plan was to use all 3 months of sabbatical leave to travel across all of south-east Asia, Japan, South Korea and also Australia but it felt like I was trying to do too much in one trip. Adding locations like South Korea and Australia would have also made the trip expensive 💸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I think travelling for 2 months instead of 3 was the right call. I started to feel a bit overwhelmed towards the end of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;travel-tips&#34;&gt;Travel Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not an expert when it comes to solo travelling and I’ve never done a trip for this long before. The journey wasn’t always smooth and I managed to run into some problems along the way. Here’s what I think people should consider before travelling for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get away from work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly immerse yourself while travelling, one of the first things I would consider doing is switching off from work (that is of course, if you didn’t quit your job to go and travel). No emails, no Slack or Microsoft Teams. Nothing. If you have a work laptop/phone, leave it at home. I personally just ended up logging out of my work email account and Slack and made sure I couldn’t log back in until after I got back from my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pack less&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I had to learn the hard way. Avoid over-packing. Easier said than done. Learn how to pack efficiently, use some packing cubes and try and travel with a single bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t do that…it was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, double-check where the nearest place to do laundry is before you need to do it. You’ll thank yourself later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus tip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - If you are going to check-in some luggage for the flight, have a day or two&amp;rsquo;s worth of clothes/essentials in your carry-on. A friend that joined me in Japan had his suitcase lost by the airline. He did get it back in the end, but had to go a few days without his stuff 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book flexible/refundable tickets, accommodation, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can cost a little extra to choose the fully refundable/flexible but there are times when you’ll be grateful you can just change your plans without any worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up doing this myself, I changed my accommodation in Bali 2 nights before arriving and extended my stay in the areas I really enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything needs to be fully flexible, however. Flights are usually fine to not book as fully refundable. Most accommodation options in south-east Asia are really cheap so I booked everything as fully refundable (I only had to pay for the first night upfront and usually paid the rest on arrival).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leads me to my next tip…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t plan everything in advance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to have a plan and some things you definitely do need to book in advance. Not every day has to be planned down to the last minute, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s better to just embrace the randomness. That’s how I ended up doing some things I would never have considered, like trying out a sensory deprivation tank in Vietnam, climbing an active volcano at 4 am in the morning to watch the sunrise, or accidentally walking right into the Sanja Festival in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll find more exciting things to do and see walking down random streets and by talking to people you encounter along the way on your trip. I certainly did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend less time on your phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. Phones are the modern-day equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. They are incredibly useful but they can also be extremely distracting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s too easy to grab your phone and start scrolling through Instagram or TikTok when you’ve got a spare moment. I try not to look at my phone too much when I’m travelling (I make an exception for when I need to contact people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay in hostels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re solo travelling, hostels are the best place to stay in my opinion. It’s cheap, sociable, and overall just really fun. Most hostels also offer private rooms if you’re not keen on sharing a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most memorable moments from my trip from thanks to the friends I met along the way. Hostels are the perfect environment for meeting new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepare for things to go wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t except so many things to go wrong on this trip. Train strikes, almost missing my flight (twice), almost paying over £200 for an Uber&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these setbacks, I still had an amazing time! Sure it was annoying/frustrating when things went wrong, but situations like that really put that Brain Tracy quote into perspective for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus the travel stories where things go wrong are always way more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;top-5-highlights&#34;&gt;Top 5 highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of exciting moments from my trip. Here’s what were my top five:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving a go-kart down the streets of Tokyo
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/sabbatical-leave/tokyo_go_karts.png&#34; alt=&#34;Me, sitting in a go-kart at an intersection of the Shibuya scramble crossing&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climbing up Mt Batur at 4 am to watch the sunrise from the peak in Bali
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/sabbatical-leave/mt_batur.png&#34; alt=&#34;A view of the valley covered in clouds from the peak of Mt Batur at 6 am in the morning&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waking up at 4:30 am in the morning to an iconic photo of the Hōkan-ji Temple in Kyoto
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/sabbatical-leave/hokan_ji.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sunrise photo of the Hōkan-ji Temple in Kyoto&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching the sunset on a boat at Ha Long Bay in Vietnam
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/sabbatical-leave/halong_bay.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sunset of the bay at Ha Long Bay in Vietnam&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a photo with this adorable chihuahua at the Senso-ji temple festive (Sanja Matsuri) in Tokyo
&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/sabbatical-leave/chihuahua.png&#34; alt=&#34;Photo of me holding a chihuahua wearing a costume with glasses for the Senso-ji temple festive (Sanja Matsuri)&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back at work now but I still have some sabbatical leave left to use. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on carrying it over to next year and using it for a trip to South Africa. I&amp;rsquo;ll likely also do a few smaller trips across Europe before that though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I really enjoy travelling, it&amp;rsquo;s always been the people that I&amp;rsquo;ve met that have made each trip ten times better. While a lot of these new friends might be scattered across the world, I plan on dropping in on a few of them from time to time as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be back on another adventure soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shoutout&#34;&gt;Shoutout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this would have been possible without my workplace. A massive thanks to Monzo for introducing the new sabbatical leave policy. While other companies do offer similar policies for long-term employees, Monzo&amp;rsquo;s policy is unmatched by any other company.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Customising my Hugo Theme</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/customising-my-hugo-theme/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 21:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/customising-my-hugo-theme/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Hugo website uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Digital Garden Hugo theme&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes in addition to using the theme. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed these changes below both for myself to refer back to and for anyone else who might find these useful to include in their own Hugo website 👇🏽&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating-lastmod-text&#34;&gt;Updating lastmod text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first changes I made was to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/ee9926c786e458476524ac571be01a7ea6a38285&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;change the lastmod front matter text&lt;/a&gt; that was displayed on the theme. Previously it would default to showing &lt;code&gt;Pruned January 2, 2023&lt;/code&gt; on articles with the &lt;code&gt;lastmod&lt;/code&gt; front matter. After my change to the article single layout it now instead shows &lt;code&gt;Last tended to on January 2, 2023&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if .Date }}
    &amp;lt;p class=&amp;#34;text-sm text-slate-500 !mb-8&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Planted {{ $date }}
		{{ if ne $lastmod $date}}
			&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Last tended to on {{ .Lastmod.Format &amp;#34;January 2, 2006&amp;#34; }}
        {{ end }}
	&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-analytics&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding Google Analytics to the site is pretty simple as it&amp;rsquo;s natively supported by the theme I&amp;rsquo;m using. Within the config.toml file, you just need to add the Google Analytics tracking ID in the format, &amp;ldquo;googleAnalytics = &amp;lsquo;TRAKCING_CODE_HERE&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue I noticed with this was the fact analytics data would be pinged back to Google Analytics while I worked on the website locally on my own machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/1bcb816700f2244d7a8337f61be5b410886f88bd#diff-5f948a63b2e0f5e8409b3a709cb74c89451854c6ded2959a6f110d5340001cc1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;replaced the config.toml file stored in the root of the repository with a config folder&lt;/a&gt; and then split the config.toml file into two files, a default file that contains all the config settings for the site, and a production config.toml file that contains only the Google Analytics tracking code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when I work on new things for the website I run the command &lt;code&gt;hugo server --environment development -D&lt;/code&gt;, which loads only the default config file. When re-building the website, I use the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command takes both config files and merges them together to build the production website, thus resolving the issue of generating accidental analytics data during testing and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;additional-article-front-matter&#34;&gt;Additional Article Front Matter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up adding a few new improvements to the article front matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;article-read-time&#34;&gt;Article read time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/a3cea7373e46fd49c8ab0c0e1499497741153237&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Added a read time for articles&lt;/a&gt;. This is automatically generated and listed for each article item. This is based on the code found &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/readingtime-define/13036/4&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ if gt .ReadingTime 1 }}
    {{ .Scratch.Set &amp;#34;readingTime&amp;#34; &amp;#34;minutes&amp;#34; }}
{{ else }}
    {{ .Scratch.Set &amp;#34;readingTime&amp;#34; &amp;#34;minute&amp;#34; }}
{{ end }}
Reading time: {{ .ReadingTime }} {{ .Scratch.Get &amp;#34;readingTime&amp;#34; }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;tags&#34;&gt;Tags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to be able to navigate my site articles by tags, so I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/29ede00b08c2f0eabe217eee315ef9924498250d&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;added tags to each article&lt;/a&gt; and updated the autogenerated tags page (was previously blank) as well. The code from the tags page is currently just copied from the theme&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme/tree/main/layouts/portfolio&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;portfolio layout&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect but it works for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; Tags:
{{ with .Param &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34; }}
    {{ range $index, $tag := (. | sort) }} 
        {{ with $.Site.GetPage (printf &amp;#34;/%s/%s&amp;#34; &amp;#34;tags&amp;#34; $tag) }}
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;{{ .Permalink }}&amp;#34;&amp;gt;#{{ $tag | urlize }}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
        {{ end }}
    {{ end }}
{{ end }}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;rel-me-verification&#34;&gt;rel-me verification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modified the social icons sidebar code to &lt;a href=&#34;ttps://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/f7cf25f796ead76c1348da976cb980e899f1302a&#34; &gt;include rel=me&lt;/a&gt;. Used for &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;verification on Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a class=&amp;#34;px-2 py-1.5 rounded-md text-sm block text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-50 {{ if eq (.URL|absURL) $permalink }} bg-slate-800 text-white dark: {{ else }} hover:bg-slate-200 dark:hover:bg-slate-700 {{ end }}&amp;#34;
    href=&amp;#34;{{ .URL }}&amp;#34; target=&amp;#34;_blank&amp;#34; rel=&amp;#34;noopener noreferrer me&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;404-page-copy&#34;&gt;404 page copy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/1dd845aa4b5894753755a2384eb4d1f784067337&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Added some copy to the 404 page&lt;/a&gt; as it was previously a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;buy-me-a-coffee-widget&#34;&gt;Buy me a coffee widget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io/commit/698221f0451372bac9b85b90fcff1b9f92321597&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Added a buy me a coffee widget&lt;/a&gt; to each article page by creating a new partial shortcode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building websites with Hugo</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/building-websites-with-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/building-websites-with-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few months, there has been a flurry of activity around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/23513418/bring-back-personal-blogging&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;personal blogs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/11/own-your-stuff/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;owning your own data&lt;/a&gt;, since &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/23551060/elon-musk-twitter-takeover-layoffs-workplace-salute-emoji&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Musk took the reins of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, a lot of people have been wondering how they can start their own websites. Since re-launching my website, I&amp;rsquo;ve had people ask me how they can make their own website in the last few weeks. To avoid repeating myself, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together a guide on how you can build a website using Hugo and GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kinsta.com/blog/hugo-static-site/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Other guides exist&lt;/a&gt;, but this one covers how I&amp;rsquo;ve set up my website in a simple and easy-to-follow guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this demo, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Hugo Bear Blog theme&lt;/a&gt; as it&amp;rsquo;s a nice minimalist theme to start with. My website uses a theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apvarun/digital-garden-hugo-theme&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Digital Garden&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://digital-garden-hugo-theme.vercel.app/articles/installation/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;installation steps&lt;/a&gt; for this theme are slightly more complicated. This guide will focus on using a simpler theme to demonstrate the basics of building websites with Hugo. There are many other &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;free Hugo themes&lt;/a&gt; you can choose from as well on the official Hugo website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One minor note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s not needed, I would recommend spending some money and buying a domain name. Usually, most people want a domain in the format of firstNameLastName[dot]com, but you can pick anything you like. For example, Sophie&amp;rsquo;s domain is &lt;a href=&#34;https://localghost.dev/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;localghost.dev&lt;/a&gt;, a fun play on words for localhost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A domain name shouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost too much and you can buy one from several domain name registrars. I bought my domain name, akashgoswami.com via &lt;a href=&#34;https://domains.google/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Google Domains&lt;/a&gt; and pay £10 a year for it (that&amp;rsquo;s less than £1 a month!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-hugo&#34;&gt;What is Hugo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; is a fast static site generator tool written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://go.dev/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. It uses templates and markdown files to generate webpages in seconds. The final result is a set of HTML files that you can deploy as a website using a hosting provider such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s use an analogy. Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend that we&amp;rsquo;re making a sandwich, instead of building a website 🥪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prepare our sandwich by laying out all the ingredients that we want to include in our sandwich. Once that&amp;rsquo;s done, you simply run the &amp;lsquo;make sandwich&amp;rsquo; command to create a sandwich within seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine we want to swap out some of those ingredients, add new ones or remove some we don&amp;rsquo;t like. We can run the &amp;lsquo;make sandwich&amp;rsquo; command again and have a new sandwich created with these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how Hugo works, but instead of making a sandwich, it generates the files needed to make a website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start building our website, there are a few things you&amp;rsquo;ll need beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-text-editor&#34;&gt;A text editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need something to edit your code in. I like using &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;.There are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/tools/editors/#visual-studio-code&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;handy Hugo extensions&lt;/a&gt; that you can install within Visual Studio Code as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;familiarity-with-using-a-command-line-app&#34;&gt;Familiarity with using a command line app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to navigate around files and run some Hugo commands using the command line interface. On macOS, the built-in command line tool is called &amp;lsquo;Terminal&amp;rsquo; (but I prefer using &lt;a href=&#34;https://iterm2.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;iTerm2&lt;/a&gt;) and on Windows it&amp;rsquo;s Powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-package-manager&#34;&gt;A Package Manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo can be installed as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/installation/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;prebuilt binary&lt;/a&gt; but I prefer using a package manager. For macOS, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to use Homebrew. For Windows, it&amp;rsquo;s Chocolatey. The installation guides for both of these package managers is well documented so I&amp;rsquo;ll leave the links to official installation instructions below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macOS - &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Installation instructions for Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows - &lt;a href=&#34;https://chocolatey.org/install&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Installation instructions for Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux - If you use a Linux-based OS then you can find the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;correct installation steps for your Linux distro here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;github-and-git&#34;&gt;GitHub (and Git)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To host the website, we&amp;rsquo;re going to use GitHub Pages, so you&amp;rsquo;ll need a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account. Create an account (please also enable 2-factor authentication) and then install &lt;a href=&#34;https://desktop.github.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;GitHub Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to install Git via your package manager if it&amp;rsquo;s not already on your machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;macOS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brew install git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install git.install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-our-website&#34;&gt;Setting up our website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, open the command line and navigate to where you want to create your website project file. I choose to create mine in Users/Akash (the default directory when you open Terminal on macOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, run the following command (but replace username with your GitHub username):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new site username.github.io
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a new folder under the same name that contains some starter files for your Hugo website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then run the following two commands to navigate into this newly created folder and create a git repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd username.github.io
git init
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, we want to add our Hugo theme and set it as well by using the following two commands&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git submodule add https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog themes/hugo-bearblog
echo &amp;#34;theme = &amp;#39;hugo-bearblog&amp;#39;&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; hugo.toml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;modifying-the-site&#34;&gt;Modifying the site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the website is set up, you can add your own content to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s best to refer to a theme&amp;rsquo;s recommended instructions. For &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;hugo-bearblog theme&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s best to refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/tree/master/exampleSite&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;exampleSite folder&lt;/a&gt; with the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;testing-and-building-the-site&#34;&gt;Testing and building the site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that&amp;rsquo;s done you can spin up the website by running &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt; and then visiting http://localhost:1313/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop the web server, just enter the command mentioned in your command line application (for macOS its Ctrl+C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve made your changes, you can build your website by running the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command. This will update the files within your public folder, which you can then deploy to a hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uploading-the-website-to-github&#34;&gt;Uploading the website to GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re happy with our website, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to upload it to GitHub. Open the GitHub Desktop application and then go to File &amp;gt; Open Local Repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you tick all the files and then enter a commit message. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be too fancy, &amp;lsquo;first commit&amp;rsquo; works well. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done that, click &amp;lsquo;Commit to main&amp;rsquo; and then the &amp;lsquo;Publish repository&amp;rsquo; button. A popup will appear asking you to name your new repository. Name it &amp;lsquo;username.github.io&amp;rsquo; and set it to be public before you click the &amp;lsquo;Publish Repository&amp;rsquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;github-actions&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To deploy your website, open the new repository via GitHub on a web browser, and then head to Settings &amp;gt; Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here you can switch the source to &amp;lsquo;GitHub Actions&amp;rsquo; and the default Hugo action should be suggested. Click configure button and then commit the code to your main branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you now head back to the Actions tab you can see a workflow running to build your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-your-domain-name-optional&#34;&gt;Setting your domain name (Optional)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a custom domain, you can set your website&amp;rsquo;s name from the Custom Domain section of the Pages settings page. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need to set your DNS records from your domain registrar to point to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once your website has been built, you can view it by entering either username.github.io or your custom domain name from your web browser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it! You&amp;rsquo;ve built your own website 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know the basics, feel free to edit anything you like; switch themes, write new posts, the choice is yours. You can now host your own website, and push new content to it by syncing your changes from your machine to GitHub via GitHub Desktop. Just remember to also run the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command to rebuild the website after making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found this guide helpful at all or want to suggest an improvement, feel free to reach out to me and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why you need a personal website</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/why-you-need-a-personal-website/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/articles/why-you-need-a-personal-website/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time and time again, we are shown that we cannot rely on third-party platforms to host our content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is constantly changing and with that, the platforms that host our content are constantly in flux. Platforms can fall just as quickly as they can rise, either by just going &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/site-deaths&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;completely offline&lt;/a&gt; or by making drastic changes to how people interact with content on their site/platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are countless examples of this happening in the past and more recently the 2022 Twitter meltdown has led to some massive changes. One of these changes is that the newsletter platform Twitter acquired just two years ago, Revue is now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23509254/twitter-revue-shutdown-newsletter-data-deletion&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;digital-platforms-are-fragile&#34;&gt;Digital platforms are fragile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s partly why I’m writing this. The shutdown of Revue has been particularly frustrating for me as someone who moved their &lt;a href=&#34;https://akashandmoney.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; from another newsletter service to Revue thinking it would be a better fit earlier this year. The announced shutdown left me scrambling to migrate my content and subscribers over the Christmas holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just goes to show you the kind of problems we face when we trust third-party platforms to host our content. Thankfully I managed to export my content &amp;amp; subscribers in time, but that got me wondering&amp;hellip;How do I avoid this happening again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;owning-your-content&#34;&gt;Owning your content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to start owning our digital content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After learning more about IndieWeb, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to follow their &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/principles&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;community principles&lt;/a&gt;. The one that stood out to me was the principle of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/own_your_data&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;owning your data&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So going forward I&amp;rsquo;ll be hosting more of my content here on this website where I don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about another platform dying out and losing my content. Hosting my content also gives me the ability to fully control how my website/content looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean I’m quitting on using other platforms entirely but instead I plan on using this website to complement my activity on other digital platforms. You&amp;rsquo;ll likely see my cross-posting most of my content from here to these other platforms for visibility (A practice coined as &lt;a href=&#34;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt; by IndieWeb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-having-a-personal-website&#34;&gt;The benefits of having a personal website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great number of benefits as to why you should have your own website but here are the reasons that really matter to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platform independent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest reason for me at the moment. All my content is owned by me and hosted on my website, overall reducing my dependence on third-party platforms for content hosting. I won&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about my account being banned, I won&amp;rsquo;t have to migrate my data after another platform announces that it&amp;rsquo;s shutting down and I don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about a platform suddenly removing its free tier and demanding payment to continue using their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, this website is built using a static site generator and hosted via &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. In the future, if I wanted to change hosting platforms or the structure of this website, I have the full flexibility to do so all while maintaining access to my content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robust &amp;amp; compact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m using a static site generator for this website now, this has simplified a lot for me and has helped make the website a lot smaller and more compact. Due to its small size, I&amp;rsquo;m able to back up the entire site to several other code hosting/cloud storage platforms with ease. Currently, you can find this website on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, using a static site generator has also done a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to SEO optimisation and has drastically improved the website&amp;rsquo;s load times as pointed out by this speed test 👇🏽

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-expect-from-this-website&#34;&gt;What to expect from this website&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you expect from this website then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m someone that has several interests and hobbies so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to box myself in with a particular theme or topic. My interests are not set in stone, and I expect them to change over time but there will likely be many recurring themes &amp;amp; topics I write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I plan on writing things around programming, tech, travel, video games, projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on, things I&amp;rsquo;m learning, life updates and anything else I find interesting or useful that I think is worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;this-is-not-a-blog&#34;&gt;This is NOT a blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of against the idea of calling this a blog. I found that having a blog always felt really pressurising. It felt like every post had to be perfect and I would end up spending too much time polishing up each post before publishing them. I would end up publishing less and less over time, while fussing over each post, trying to chase that sense of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yusuf.fyi/posts/perfectionism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;perfection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-digital-garden&#34;&gt;Welcome to my Digital Garden!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to like the term &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;digital garden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and I think it better suits what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to achieve with this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website is my public digital garden. A place for me to cultivate, and grow my thoughts, ideas, and other bits of information freely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote from Maggie Appleton explains it well while keeping it short and simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I&amp;rsquo;d like to build. An inter-connected garden of information around the things that interest me. I like to think of it more as being a content &lt;em&gt;curator&lt;/em&gt; rather than being a content creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I think there is a lot of information out there in the world and there&amp;rsquo;s only so much the human brain can hold and retain. Having a secondary space (almost like a second brain) for collecting and organising meaningful notes, thoughts and ideas can help free cognitive capacity, a bit like backing up your computer&amp;rsquo;s hard drive to cloud storage to free up memory on the local disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have multiple digital gardens, scattered across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instapaper.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/i/akash56&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, etc, but this is the first one I&amp;rsquo;ll be publishing publicly as a centralised home to share what I find important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as this is for other people to read, this is also for me to reflect on myself and build upon existing ideas and thoughts of mine that would otherwise usually get lost among the various note-taking apps I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;inspiration&#34;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about rebuilding my website for some time, but never got around to doing it. It was thanks to a handful of people that I found the motivation to start working on this site again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to give a little shoutout to them for how they helped me find the direction I wanted to go with this website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yusuf.fyi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;Yusuf Bouzekri&lt;/a&gt; - For his posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yusuf.fyi/posts/perfectionism&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;perfectionism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yusuf.fyi/posts/the-content-creation-dilemma&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34; &gt;the content creation dilemma&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me actually publish this post after reading them both.&lt;/li&gt;
