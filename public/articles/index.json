        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eThis week, \u003ca href=\"https://robinhood.com/gb/en/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eRobinhood\u003c/a\u003e, a US-based stock trading app, went \u003ca href=\"https://www.cityam.com/robinhood-launches-to-uk-customers/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003elive in the UK\u003c/a\u003e. As someone who is very much interested in investing and having tried out other app-based investment platforms in the past, I thought it would be a good idea to share my thoughts on the platform and if it’s worth using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny enough, I had just watched \u003ca href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dumb-money/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eDumb Money\u003c/a\u003e, covering the GameStop sage in 2021 on a flight back from South Africa yesterday so Robinhood’s UK launch is a well-timed surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-website\"\u003eThe website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s first have a look at Robinhood’s website for its UK launch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-hero-section\"\u003eThe hero section\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon the first visit to the UK Robinhood website, you’re greeted by a well-designed hero image of London, featuring Big Ben, the river Thames and a glimpse of the London Eye on the right. The main title features Robinhood’s key promised feature ‘Trade US stocks without commission or FX fees’.\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/hero.png\" alt=\"Robinhood UK website, hero section\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"other-costs\"\u003eOther Costs\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath that is a hyperlink stating ‘Other costs apply’ and that capital is at risk. Pretty standard for a stock trading platform. Clicking the ‘Other costs apply’ link takes you to \u003ca href=\"https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHUK_Fee_Schedule.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ea PDF that lists a few fees Robinhood does charge\u003c/a\u003e. Most of these fees are listed as $0 except for the Regulatory Trading Fees section and a single fee/rate under the Margin section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two fees under Regulatory Trading Fees are a regulatory fee of $8.00 per $1,000,000 of principal (sells only), rounded up to the nearest penny and a trading activity fee of $0.000166 per share (sells only), rounded up to the nearest penny and no greater than $8.30. These fees are set by US law and regulation outside of Robinhood’s control and there are similar fees when you buy UK stocks. Additionally, there are some small disclaimers for each of these fees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"regulatory-trading-fees\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegulatory Trading Fees\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the regulatory fee, Robinhood doesn’t pass this fee on to you for sales with a notional value of $500 or less. For the trading activity fee, the limit on this fee is based on the execution of your order, which can occur in parts. Robinhood doesn’t pass this fee on to you for sales of 50 shares or less. Awesome news for people just getting into investing and those who are making smaller and infrequent trades via Robinhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"margin-fees\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargin Fees\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the Margin section is a single fee, a ‘Standard Margin Rate’ of 12%. I don’t personally do any margin trading, but I imagine this rate has to do with the interest rate charged for money borrowed for margin trading on Robinhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a small disclaimer stating that the ‘Margin interest rate shown is as of 26/7/2023 and is calculated by adding 6.5% to the upper bound of the Target Federal Funds Rate which is set by the Federal Reserve, and is subject to change. The formula used to calculate the margin interest rate is subject to change at Robinhood’s discretion.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty standard stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch5 id=\"exchange-rate-fees\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExchange Rate Fees\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one isn’t listed on the PDF but rather further down the home page under the comparison, table Robinhood has listed. Since Robinhood offers stock trading in US stocks, and most UK investors will not have access to a USD funding source, there’s going to be a need to convert pounds to dollars and vice versa.\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/third-party-cost.png\" alt=\"Third party cost disclaimer under comparison table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood holds funds in USD and thus charges a 0.03% ‘third party cost’ (translation - fee by third party exchange provider) that will be included in the exchange rate. Technically this would mean that Robinhood has an FX fee, but this fee goes to the third-party exchange company that exchanges your money from pounds to USD as a service fee and that this is not something Robinhood themselves control or profit from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy comparison, Trading212 charges a 0.15% currency conversion rate fee when buying shares that require a currency conversion (e.g. buying US stocks in USD via an account that holds funds in GBP). Robinhood’s fee is 80% lower in comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"featured-benefits\"\u003eFeatured benefits\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrolling down the main website, we can see the top 4 features Robinhood offers; trading stocks with no commission and FX fees, 5% interest on cash holdings, getting a free stock to get started and being able to trade stocks 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"trading-us-stocks\"\u003eTrading US Stocks\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty self-explanatory and is the main feature of several other trading platforms. It will be interesting to see the stocks Robinhood offers compared to trading platforms, but now Robinhood boasts that it will be possible to purchase shares in over 6,000 companies listed on US stock markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"interest-on-cash\"\u003eInterest (on cash)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood currently offers 5% interest on cash held in their USD account. This is a rate that is only offered to Robinhood Gold members (which costs $5 a month), while regular Robinhood US investors earn 1.5% on cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time of writing this, the current base rate from the Bank of England is 5.25%. Most banks trying to acquire new deposits will offer a rate on instant access savings accounts that is just below the base rate in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood is doing the same thing here but since the money is held in a USD account, the interest being earned comes from the US Fed interest rate which currently sits at 5.50%, a little higher than the base rate from the Bank of England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, Robinhood is making use of a partner bank network made up of 12 banks to offer a combined FDIC insurance coverage of 2.25 million USD. This isn’t mentioned on the UK website but if you check the \u003ca href=\"https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eFAQ section for Robinhood Gold\u003c/a\u003e on the US website, it mentions this and how it works\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/gold-fdic-insureance.png\" alt=\"Robinhood US Gold, Q - How can you give 9x the FDIC insurance of a standard bank s $250K? A - That\u0026rsquo;s easy\u0026hellip;we\u0026rsquo;ve got 12 partner banks so you can enjoy a combined coverage of up to $2.25 million FDIC insurance across all of them.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust bear in mind that, if you have any accounts with any of these partner banks then the $250,000 FDIC insurance (per partner bank) is shared across all accounts to hold with this partner bank, but it is highly unlikely that this will apply to the majority of UK investors who will not have a USD checking account before signing up to Robinhood).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also means that the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which protects up to £85,000 does \u003cstrong\u003eNOT\u003c/strong\u003e apply to this account since it is not a UK trading account (technically).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcluding the 0.03% deposit and withdrawal ‘third party cost’ fee, this could make Robinhood a competitive savings account provider, although the FAQs on Robinhood Gold also mention that withdrawals can take up to 4-5 days (or pay a 1.5% fee for an instant withdrawal) but I didn’t see this mentioned anywhere on the UK website.\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/withdrawals.png\" alt=\"Robinhood US Gold, Q - Is it hard to withdraw my cash? How long does it take to get it out? A - It\u0026rsquo;s your money, you can access your money whenever you want. Bank transfers can take up to 4-5 days or you can choose the instant withdrawal option for a 1.5% fee.\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"free-stocks\"\u003eFree stocks\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s quite normal for trading platforms to offer a free share if you’ve been referred to an account via a refer-a-friend program (which was funnily enough made popular by Robinhood in the US).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, also claims to offer a free fractional share when you sign up to Robinhood in addition to the Refer a Friend program (normally there are no free shares given if you do not sign up via a referral link with other investment platforms).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terms state that you can be offered between $7-$175 if you sign up and fund your account. They also state that 96% of participants will receive a cash value of $7 to $8 (net), and provide a handy table to see your probability of what the value of your free share will be.\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/reward-probability.png\" alt=\"Reward probability table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll be able to apply this cash to purchase a share from 22 stocks (selected by choosing the 2 largest S\u0026amp;P 500 companies within the top 11 sectors based on market cap).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"24-hour-trading-on-weekdays\"\u003e24-hour trading (on weekdays)\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood also boasts that you can trade 24 hours, 5 days a week with a disclaimer that additional risks apply to trades made outside of regular market hours. A nice feature but personally I stick to making all my investment trading during regular market hours so this isn’t something I’m interested in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"pricing-and-comparison\"\u003ePricing and comparison\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving on to the pricing and comparison table with other UK brokerages, I won’t go into too much detail here but I will say, that the comparison table includes Freetrade but purposely excludes \u003ca href=\"https://trading212.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eTrading212\u003c/a\u003e, which also has zero commission fees, a small 0.15% FX fee on currency conversions, 5.2% interest on cash and 24/5 trading. The table here isn’t lying, but it’s clear they’ve omitted their true competitor from this table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than that, Robinhood has a great page breaking down \u003ca href=\"https://robinhood.com/gb/en/price/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ehow its fees work\u003c/a\u003e, and I’m surprised this was not linked in the hero section and instead a PDF file was chosen to be linked to the ‘Other costs apply’ text (might be something to do with regulation stuff).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nice bonus on this page, is that there is \u003ca href=\"https://robinhood.com/gb/en/support/articles/how-robinhood-makes-money/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ea link to another page that explains how Robinhood makes money\u003c/a\u003e. I would give it a read if you were curious. Seems pretty normal for a commission-free trading platform in my opinion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"protection-commitments\"\u003eProtection commitments\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to skip over the interest on cash section since we’ve already covered it and the fractional shares call out since this is a pretty standard feature across trading apps now. Instead, let’s look at Robinhood’s ‘Protection commitments’. This is also standard across most trading platforms now. Password hashing and encryption and used as standard and they also offer two-factor authentication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that a strong and unique password should be used in combination with two-factor authentication. There were incidents in the past where Robinhood US accounts were hacked and drained due to password reuse (it’s up to investors to set a unique password) and not enabling two-factor authentication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/banking/robinhood-20-million-settlement-who-is-eligible-for-money/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eRobinhood faced a 20 million dollar class action lawsuit\u003c/a\u003e where around 40,000 customers said their accounts had been hacked. They also faced \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/robinhood-announces-data-security-incident-update/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ea data breach where the data of 7 million investors were stolen\u003c/a\u003e via a social engineering attack on a customer support employee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood’s security practices seem to have gotten a lot better since then. Robinhood claims to cover 100% of direct losses due to unauthorised account activity that is not \u003cstrong\u003eyour\u003c/strong\u003e fault (this is legal speak for, you better use a unique password and enable two-factor authentication).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat surprised me was that Robinhood offered me the ability to create a passkey for accessing my Robinhood account after I had created it. A nice (and secure) addition that gets a thumbs-up from me.\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/robinhood-passkey.png\" alt=\"Robinhood passkey creation\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"learning\"\u003eLearning\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow the protection commitments section is the final section on the home page, \u003ca href=\"https://learn.robinhood.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eRobinhood Learn\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood Learn offers a large assortment of articles to learn more about the various parts of investing. If you’re new to investing, this is a great place to start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing I would skip is the option trading section. I don’t think this is relevant for most investors as there’s a higher risk of losing your money with options trading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"signing-up-via-the-app\"\u003eSigning up (via the app)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to sign up for a Robinhood UK account and noticed a few things during the signup flow I thought were worth mentioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"pre-selected-margin-account-signup\"\u003ePre-selected Margin Account Signup\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the signup flow is pretty standard (and well-designed in my opinion), but there was one part on the final step of creating the account that alarmed me. On the final part of the Brokerage account application page, I noticed that a box was preselected, ‘Robinhood Margin Account Agreement’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/margin-account.png\" alt=\"Pre-selected margin account\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving this option ticked would create a margin account instead of a ‘Non-Margin account’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think it’s pretty sneaky having this option pre-selected without really explaining the risks that come with a margin trading account. There are large risks that come with margin trading and in addition to that Robinhood also charges that 12% margin rate they mentioned in their ‘other costs’ if you end up using this feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out that I was right to be alarmed by this because, on the same day, Robinhood announced it was going live in the UK, they ended up \u003ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/trading-app-robinhood-drops-margin-investing-uk-launch-2024-03-19/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003epausing their plans to lend to UK-based customers pending talks with regulators\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargin trading is not something that is typically offered to UK investors but Robinhood would have been allowed to offer this feature due to some type of “regulatory exemption” but it’s not clear what that exemption is exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy opinion - stay away from margin trading. Investing already comes with risk, so why add more unnecessary risk, especially if you are a new investor? I ended up just unchecking the box and continuing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"funding\"\u003eFunding\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunding the account was pretty easy. This is handled by open banking via Truelayer. No issues here and worked as expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"identity-verification\"\u003eIdentity Verification\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve signed up for dozens of fintech apps and they all follow a similar identification verification process. Take a photo of your ID and take a video or photo of yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one part of Robinhood’s process that threw me off, however…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobinhood asked me for a photo of my ‘tax document’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/img/initial-thoughts-on-robinhood/tax-document.png\" alt=\"tax document\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost investment platforms will ask for a NIN (National Insurance number) but Robinhood also wanted a colour photo of a paper copy of either a payslip, P45 or P60. This is the first time I’ve ever been asked for this. Thankfully I was able to print out a copy fairly quickly and continue with the application process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"accessing-the-app\"\u003eAccessing the app\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter submitting that, my account application is still in review, but in the meantime, I have been granted access to other parts of the app. Right now I’m able to view stocks in the app and read the latest news on various stocks as well. All that’s left now is for my account to be approved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"will-i-use-robinhood-going-forward\"\u003eWill I use Robinhood going forward?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Robinhood shows a lot of promise, I likely wouldn’t be using it in the future for investing. There are two key reasons why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"no-isa-offering\"\u003eNo ISA offering\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no Stocks and Shares ISA offering, meaning there is no way to make gains on investment via Robinhood in a tax-efficient manner. I would rather focus on investing via a Stocks and Shares ISA which allows for tax-free gains. Currently, the amount you can put into ISAs in a single tax year is £20,000 a year (or about £1,666 a month). Most people never fully max out their ISA allowance every tax year and they would likely be better off focusing on doing that before looking into general investment accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, if Robinhood only plans to offer accounts in USD then they will never be allowed to offer a stocks and shares ISA as HMRC rules do not allow you to hold foreign currency within an ISA (this is the same case for other apps such as Trading212 which offers a stocks and shares ISA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"no-etfs\"\u003eNo ETFs\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Robinhood focuses on the US stock market, it offers US-listed ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). Currently, under local and European regulations, it’s not possible to buy US-listed ETFs in the UK, which leaves investors with only being able to buy shares in single stocks (a lot riskier than buying an ETF).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would hope Robinhood offers a localised ETF equivalent offerings similar to their competitors in the UK but given the large focus being buying and selling US stocks and the account being held in USD I don’t think this will happen any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall while Robinhood’s offering is unique and competitive in terms of fees compared to other brokerages in the UK. I think it makes more sense to focus on filling up a Stocks and Shares ISA for tax efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would only consider looking into a Robinhood account after fully utilising my ISA allowance first. I’m more of a long term passive investor, and I don’t think Robinhood is well suited for passive investors that are looking to solely focus on buying ETFs in a tax efficient investment account. There are other platforms that are better suited for passive investing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this is just my opinion. Remember, none of this is financial advice. I just wanted to share some initial thoughts on Robinhood’s launch in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

I never thought about making DRM-free copies of my eBooks until I read about how \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@bjax_/a-tale-of-unwanted-disruption-my-week-without-amazon-df1074e3818b\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ean engineer had his Amazon account suspended\u003c/a\u003e due to a delivery driver\u0026rsquo;s false claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat really got me thinking about how I would feel if I lost access to my Amazon account. I’ve purchased most of my ebooks from Amazon. Losing access would mean losing the majority of my digital library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo avoid such a situation, I decided it was time to make a copy of the digital eBooks I purchased from Amazon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article covers how I removed the DRM from my Kindle ebooks so I can read my books on any device without needing to use a Kindle app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore going further, I’ll answer some questions some folks might have 👇🏽\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"quick-frequently-asked-questions-faq\"\u003eQuick Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is DRM?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It’s a type of tech used to control and manage access to copyrighted content. Its main purpose is to prevent content from being shared with those that did not pay for it and to also prevent the content from being modified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat issues does it pose?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile DRM is used to prevent piracy, it can cause issues for legitimate users as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, say you bought a video game that comes with some DRM that checks you own the game by contacting the game publisher’s server before you can play the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow imagine if the game publisher went out of business and with that, the server used for the DRM check goes offline with it. Now you’re in a situation where you’ve paid for a video game but you can no longer access it due to the DRM server going offline (Also what if you just wanted to play the game offline/without an internet connection?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital books from Amazon, are only intended to be read on Kindle devices and via the Kindle app using your Amazon account. If you lost access to your Amazon account for any reason, you would essentially lose access to the books you bought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should you care about removing DRM from your eBooks?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s simple. Not having DRM on your eBooks means you can read them on any device using any app you want without having to worry about losing access to your books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it illegal to remove DRM from your digital items?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Just don’t distribute the DRM-free books you have as that would be illegal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"disclaimer\"\u003eDisclaimer\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere a several guides online that explain how to do this, I initially followed those methods but I got some errors when following these guides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow I’ve listed the steps that worked for me.

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eI took 9 weeks off work. Of those 9 weeks, I spent 8 travelling. This is a summary of how I found my time off and what I did, things I learnt from my first long-term travel trip and my favourite highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-sabbatical-leave\"\u003eWhat is sabbatical leave?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick 101 - sabbatical leave is an extended period of time away from work. Common reasons for taking sabbatical leave are to pursue interests outside of work; such as travelling, studying, volunteering or even just to take a break to just rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-did-i-get-my-sabbatical-leave\"\u003eHow did I get my sabbatical leave?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work at a bank called \u003ca href=\"https://monzo.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eMonzo\u003c/a\u003e and about a year ago they introduced a new benefit. 3 months of paid sabbatical leave for those that had been at the company for 4 years. It just happens so that I was months away from hitting my 4 year work anniversary at the time of this announcement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, I did the logical thing and started planning how I would spend these 3 months away from work right away. In the end, I’ve taken 9 weeks of sabbatical leave this year, with plans of using the remaining next year for another trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"terms-and-conditions\"\u003eTerms and Conditions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the catch? It almost sounds too good to be true right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, there was nothing that was of any concern. There were only two conditions I had to be aware of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first was that for the amount of time, I took as sabbatical leave, I needed to give double the length of that as my notice for taking the leave. Since I took 9 weeks off, I had to give 18 weeks of notice before taking the time off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other condition was that you’re required to keep working for the company for at least 6 months after taking sabbatical leave or I\u0026rsquo;d have to pay it back. Sounds pretty reasonable to me. I\u0026rsquo;m not planning on quitting anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-did-i-do-during-my-sabbatical\"\u003eWhat did I do during my sabbatical?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, I was really conflicted about what to do with my time off. Part of me really wanted to travel and another part of me wanted to stay at home and work on several projects I just never found the time for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I decided to prioritise travelling and also make use of the credit card points/air miles I’d been saving up for the last 6 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a lot of planning, I ended up visiting 6 countries on my trip; The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. I went slowly through these countries to take the time to explore without feeling like I didn’t have enough time to do everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOriginally my plan was to use all 3 months of sabbatical leave to travel across all of south-east Asia, Japan, South Korea and also Australia but it felt like I was trying to do too much in one trip. Adding locations like South Korea and Australia would have also made the trip expensive 💸\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, I think travelling for 2 months instead of 3 was the right call. I started to feel a bit overwhelmed towards the end of the trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"travel-tips\"\u003eTravel Tips\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not an expert when it comes to solo travelling and I’ve never done a trip for this long before. The journey wasn’t always smooth and I managed to run into some problems along the way. Here’s what I think people should consider before travelling for long periods of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet away from work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo truly immerse yourself while travelling, one of the first things I would consider doing is switching off from work (that is of course, if you didn’t quit your job to go and travel). No emails, no Slack or Microsoft Teams. Nothing. If you have a work laptop/phone, leave it at home. I personally just ended up logging out of my work email account and Slack and made sure I couldn’t log back in until after I got back from my trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePack less\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is something I had to learn the hard way. Avoid over-packing. Easier said than done. Learn how to pack efficiently, use some packing cubes and try and travel with a single bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t do that…it was difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, double-check where the nearest place to do laundry is before you need to do it. You’ll thank yourself later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus tip\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e - If you are going to check-in some luggage for the flight, have a day or two\u0026rsquo;s worth of clothes/essentials in your carry-on. A friend that joined me in Japan had his suitcase lost by the airline. He did get it back in the end, but had to go a few days without his stuff 😬\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBook flexible/refundable tickets, accommodation, etc.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can cost a little extra to choose the fully refundable/flexible but there are times when you’ll be grateful you can just change your plans without any worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ended up doing this myself, I changed my accommodation in Bali 2 nights before arriving and extended my stay in the areas I really enjoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot everything needs to be fully flexible, however. Flights are usually fine to not book as fully refundable. Most accommodation options in south-east Asia are really cheap so I booked everything as fully refundable (I only had to pay for the first night upfront and usually paid the rest on arrival).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leads me to my next tip…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t plan everything in advance\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s nice to have a plan and some things you definitely do need to book in advance. Not every day has to be planned down to the last minute, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it’s better to just embrace the randomness. That’s how I ended up doing some things I would never have considered, like trying out a sensory deprivation tank in Vietnam, climbing an active volcano at 4 am in the morning to watch the sunrise, or accidentally walking right into the Sanja Festival in Tokyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll find more exciting things to do and see walking down random streets and by talking to people you encounter along the way on your trip. I certainly did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpend less time on your phone\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t get me wrong. Phones are the modern-day equivalent of a Swiss Army knife. They are incredibly useful but they can also be extremely distracting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s too easy to grab your phone and start scrolling through Instagram or TikTok when you’ve got a spare moment. I try not to look at my phone too much when I’m travelling (I make an exception for when I need to contact people).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStay in hostels\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re solo travelling, hostels are the best place to stay in my opinion. It’s cheap, sociable, and overall just really fun. Most hostels also offer private rooms if you’re not keen on sharing a room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the most memorable moments from my trip from thanks to the friends I met along the way. Hostels are the perfect environment for meeting new people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrepare for things to go wrong\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t except so many things to go wrong on this trip. Train strikes, almost missing my flight (twice), almost paying over £200 for an Uber\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite these setbacks, I still had an amazing time! Sure it was annoying/frustrating when things went wrong, but situations like that really put that Brain Tracy quote into perspective for me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlus the travel stories where things go wrong are always way more interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"top-5-highlights\"\u003eTop 5 highlights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of exciting moments from my trip.

I\u0026rsquo;ll likely also do a few smaller trips across Europe before that though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I really enjoy travelling, it\u0026rsquo;s always been the people that I\u0026rsquo;ve met that have made each trip ten times better. While a lot of these new friends might be scattered across the world, I plan on dropping in on a few of them from time to time as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be back on another adventure soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"shoutout\"\u003eShoutout\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, none of this would have been possible without my workplace.

Since re-launching my website, I\u0026rsquo;ve had people ask me how they can make their own website in the last few weeks. To avoid repeating myself, I\u0026rsquo;ve put together a guide on how you can build a website using Hugo and GitHub Pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://kinsta.com/blog/hugo-static-site/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eOther guides exist\u003c/a\u003e, but this one covers how I\u0026rsquo;ve set up my website in a simple and easy-to-follow guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this demo, I\u0026rsquo;m going to be using the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eHugo Bear Blog theme\u003c/a\u003e as it\u0026rsquo;s a nice minimalist theme to start with.

There are many other \u003ca href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003efree Hugo themes\u003c/a\u003e you can choose from as well on the official Hugo website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne minor note\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it\u0026rsquo;s not needed, I would recommend spending some money and buying a domain name. Usually, most people want a domain in the format of firstNameLastName[dot]com, but you can pick anything you like. For example, Sophie\u0026rsquo;s domain is \u003ca href=\"https://localghost.dev/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003elocalghost.dev\u003c/a\u003e, a fun play on words for localhost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA domain name shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cost too much and you can buy one from several domain name registrars. I bought my domain name, akashgoswami.com via \u003ca href=\"https://domains.google/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGoogle Domains\u003c/a\u003e and pay £10 a year for it (that\u0026rsquo;s less than £1 a month!).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-hugo\"\u003eWhat is Hugo?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://gohugo.io/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eHugo\u003c/a\u003e is a fast static site generator tool written in \u003ca href=\"https://go.dev/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGo\u003c/a\u003e. It uses templates and markdown files to generate webpages in seconds.

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eTime and time again, we are shown that we cannot rely on third-party platforms to host our content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe internet is constantly changing and with that, the platforms that host our content are constantly in flux. Platforms can fall just as quickly as they can rise, either by just going \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/site-deaths\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ecompletely offline\u003c/a\u003e or by making drastic changes to how people interact with content on their site/platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are countless examples of this happening in the past and more recently the 2022 Twitter meltdown has led to some massive changes. One of these changes is that the newsletter platform Twitter acquired just two years ago, Revue is now \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/14/23509254/twitter-revue-shutdown-newsletter-data-deletion\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eshutting down\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"digital-platforms-are-fragile\"\u003eDigital platforms are fragile\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s partly why I’m writing this. The shutdown of Revue has been particularly frustrating for me as someone who moved their \u003ca href=\"https://akashandmoney.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003enewsletter\u003c/a\u003e from another newsletter service to Revue thinking it would be a better fit earlier this year. The announced shutdown left me scrambling to migrate my content and subscribers over the Christmas holidays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt just goes to show you the kind of problems we face when we trust third-party platforms to host our content. Thankfully I managed to export my content \u0026amp; subscribers in time, but that got me wondering\u0026hellip;How do I avoid this happening again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"owning-your-content\"\u003eOwning your content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s time to start owning our digital content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter learning more about IndieWeb, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to follow their \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/principles\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ecommunity principles\u003c/a\u003e. The one that stood out to me was the principle of \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/own_your_data\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eowning your data\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo going forward I\u0026rsquo;ll be hosting more of my content here on this website where I don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about another platform dying out and losing my content. Hosting my content also gives me the ability to fully control how my website/content looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis doesn’t mean I’m quitting on using other platforms entirely but instead I plan on using this website to complement my activity on other digital platforms. You\u0026rsquo;ll likely see my cross-posting most of my content from here to these other platforms for visibility (A practice coined as \u003ca href=\"https://indieweb.org/POSSE\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ePOSSE\u003c/a\u003e by IndieWeb).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-benefits-of-having-a-personal-website\"\u003eThe benefits of having a personal website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a great number of benefits as to why you should have your own website but here are the reasons that really matter to me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlatform independent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the biggest reason for me at the moment. All my content is owned by me and hosted on my website, overall reducing my dependence on third-party platforms for content hosting. I won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about my account being banned, I won\u0026rsquo;t have to migrate my data after another platform announces that it\u0026rsquo;s shutting down and I don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about a platform suddenly removing its free tier and demanding payment to continue using their services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, this website is built using a static site generator and hosted via \u003ca href=\"https://pages.github.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGitHub Pages\u003c/a\u003e. In the future, if I wanted to change hosting platforms or the structure of this website, I have the full flexibility to do so all while maintaining access to my content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRobust \u0026amp; compact\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I\u0026rsquo;m using a static site generator for this website now, this has simplified a lot for me and has helped make the website a lot smaller and more compact. Due to its small size, I\u0026rsquo;m able to back up the entire site to several other code hosting/cloud storage platforms with ease. Currently, you can find this website on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Skyth3r/Skyth3r.github.io\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, using a static site generator has also done a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to SEO optimisation and has drastically improved the website\u0026rsquo;s load times as pointed out by this speed test 👇🏽\n\u003cimg src=\"/img/personal-website/pagespeed-insights-desktop-100.png\" alt=\"Pagespeed insights results desktop: 100% all pagespeed-insights-desktop-100-performace\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-to-expect-from-this-website\"\u003eWhat to expect from this website\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what can you expect from this website then?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m someone that has several interests and hobbies so I don\u0026rsquo;t want to box myself in with a particular theme or topic. My interests are not set in stone, and I expect them to change over time but there will likely be many recurring themes \u0026amp; topics I write about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, I plan on writing things around programming, tech, travel, video games, projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, things I\u0026rsquo;m learning, life updates and anything else I find interesting or useful that I think is worth sharing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"this-is-not-a-blog\"\u003eThis is NOT a blog\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m kind of against the idea of calling this a blog. I found that having a blog always felt really pressurising. It felt like every post had to be perfect and I would end up spending too much time polishing up each post before publishing them. I would end up publishing less and less over time, while fussing over each post, trying to chase that sense of \u003ca href=\"https://www.yusuf.fyi/posts/perfectionism\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eperfection\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"welcome-to-my-digital-garden\"\u003eWelcome to my Digital Garden!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve come to like the term \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003edigital garden\u003c/a\u003e\u0026rdquo; and I think it better suits what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to achieve with this website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis website is my public digital garden.

Having a secondary space (almost like a second brain) for collecting and organising meaningful notes, thoughts and ideas can help free cognitive capacity, a bit like backing up your computer\u0026rsquo;s hard drive to cloud storage to free up memory on the local disk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have multiple digital gardens, scattered across \u003ca href=\"https://www.notion.so/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eNotion\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instapaper.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eInstapaper\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://readwise.io/i/akash56\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eReadwise\u003c/a\u003e, etc, but this is the first one I\u0026rsquo;ll be publishing publicly as a centralised home to share what I find important to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as this is for other people to read, this is also for me to reflect on myself and build upon existing ideas and thoughts of mine that would otherwise usually get lost among the various note-taking apps I use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"inspiration\"\u003eInspiration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve thought about rebuilding my website for some time, but never got around to doing it.
