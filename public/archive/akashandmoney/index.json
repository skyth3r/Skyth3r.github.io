I‚Äôm just a guy that is interested in personal finance (and by extension, cryptocurrencies).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"bias\"\u003eBias\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing I should mention is that my option will be slightly biased. I own a small amount of Bitcoin, so I‚Äôll be trying to show a balanced view here but I thought it was worth mentioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-makes-bitcoin-different\"\u003eWhat makes Bitcoin different?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve it or not, \u003ca href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/tech/were-there-cryptocurrencies-bitcoin/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eBitcoin was not the world‚Äôs first attempt at a cryptocurrency\u003c/a\u003e but rather it was the first successful decentralised cryptocurrency to have taken off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is an open-source decentralised peer to peer currency that had no central authority that controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always like comparing it to the likes of email, because who owns email?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer is no one because it‚Äôs an open standard that other companies have built things on top of, but they don‚Äôt ‚Äòown‚Äô email because of this. The same can be said for Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to that, there are a number of factors to Bitcoin‚Äôs success since its invention but there are five main factors that make Bitcoin valuable or desirable as a currency to people. Let‚Äôs have a look at each one in a bit more detail below‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"scarcity\"\u003eScarcity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fixed-supply\"\u003eFixed Supply\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScarcity is the first factor that makes Bitcoin different from other currencies. Scarcity simply means that there is a limited supply or shortage of a certain thing. A lot of things have a limited supply if you think about it, oil, computer chips, gold, limited edition trainers, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Bitcoin‚Äôs case, there are a maximum number of Bitcoins that can ever exist. Bitcoin was hardcoded with a fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis might sound like a lot but roughly 2.8 to 3.8 million bitcoins are said to already be lost and there are bitcoin wallets with hundreds if not thousands of bitcoins already in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis creates a limited supply of bitcoins in circulation right now and once all 21 million bitcoins have been mined, there will never be any new bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraditional currencies like the US dollar or the British pound sterling, don‚Äôt have a limited supply as more can be printed when needed. This is partly why traditional currencies lose value over time due to inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin on the other hand is not subject to inflation but rather deflation as creating new bitcoins becomes increasingly more difficult over time due to‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"halving-events\"\u003eHalving Events\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is a \u003cem\u003e‚ÄúHalving Event‚Äù\u003c/em\u003e you say?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe halving is something that currently happens roughly every 4 years. Currently, when a block is successful ‚Äòmined‚Äô, the person (or machine) that mined this block is given a reward in bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, this reward was initially set at 50 bitcoins. 4 years later it dropped to 25 bitcoins and in 2016 it dropped to 12.5 bitcoins per block. The last halving event was in 2020 and the reward now sits at 6.25 bitcoins per successfully mined block. The next halving event is expected to happen around 2024 when the block reward will drop to just 3.125 bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe difficulty (or energy required) of mining these blocks does not decrease, so obtaining new bitcoins becomes harder due to the decreasing block reward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"halving-events.png\" alt=\"image showing bitcoin halving events from 2009, 2013, 2016 and 2020 where the reward has havled starting at 50 BTC in 2009 to 6.25BTC in 2020\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reward of mining a block halves roughly every 4 years\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese halvings help ensure a steady and predictable supply of new bitcoins, where the last bitcoin is expected to be mined around the year 2140.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply along with these periodic halving events, the overall supply of new bitcoins decreases over time. Therefore a lot of people believe that the overall value of a bitcoin will increase due to this contrasted supply of new bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"durability\"\u003eDurability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurability is the ability to be able to withstand damage. Since bitcoins are not physical or digital objects, they can‚Äôt be destroyed and they don‚Äôt ‚Äòwear down‚Äô over time. Instead, the ownership of bitcoins is recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blockchain is a decentralised ledger with a copy of every single transaction that has taken place on the Bitcoin network. As long as you retain access to the bitcoin wallet (or more specifically the private keys), then you‚Äôll always have access to your bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is often compared to gold when discussing durability as, like gold, it can‚Äôt be destroyed and it also can‚Äôt be physically ‚Äòlost‚Äô because it‚Äôs not a physical object like gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurability is a favourable quality in a currency, which is something Bitcoin provides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"portability\"\u003ePortability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoins (and cryptocurrencies in general) are probably some of the most portable currencies we have today. Since they have no physical form, there‚Äôs no storage risk that comes with traditional currencies or gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Bitcoin is very portable, it‚Äôs relatively easy to send a large amount of money (or value) using the Bitcoin network without a middleman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you were to attempt the same with say a million dollars you would either have to use a trusted third party like a bank which could take a lot longer at sending such a large amount of money or you could move this money in cash which would be incredibly costly and risky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Bitcoin, on the other hand, you could ‚Äòtechnically‚Äô carry large amounts of bitcoins with you on your phone via a mobile wallet app or a USB stick and it wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äòweigh‚Äô you down the same way carrying a lot of coins or banknotes would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin nails portability thanks to the fact it‚Äôs fully digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"divisibility\"\u003eDivisibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is extremely divisible, meaning you can send or receive tiny factions of a bitcoin very easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smallest unit of bitcoin is a ‚Äòsat‚Äô or satoshi, which is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin, or 0.00000001 bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"bitcoin-pizza.png\" alt=\"image showing how bitcoin is divisible like a pizza\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoins are divisible, like a pizza and a single unit of a bitcoin is called a satoshi or \u0026lsquo;sat\u0026rsquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis allows bitcoins to be used for smaller transactions and even micro-transactions, such as tips, buying small things like coffees and so on. Most of these micro-transactions are made using a layer 2 solution called \u003ca href=\"https://lightning.network/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eThe Lightning Network\u003c/a\u003e for faster and cheaper payments ‚ö°\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fungibility\"\u003eFungibility\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin‚Äôs final factor is fungible, meaning each and every bitcoin is identical. Each of the 21 million bitcoins is exactly the same. Fungibility is a desirable trait within any currency, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-future-of-bitcoin\"\u003eThe Future of Bitcoin\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now that we‚Äôve explored the five factors that make Bitcoin different, let‚Äôs talk about what this means for Bitcoin going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe popularity of Bitcoin is \u003cem\u003elikely\u003c/em\u003e going to grow in the future. This doesn‚Äôt mean the price of Bitcoin itself is going to increase but rather we will likely see other companies and countries holding onto Bitcoin as a reserve of some kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are actually \u003ca href=\"https://bitcointreasuries.net/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ea few companies that now own and hold Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e; MicroStrategy, Tesla, Block (formally Square), Coinbase and even one of the ‚Äòbig four‚Äô accounting organisations, KPMG!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eWe have just completed an allocation of cryptoassets to our corporate treasury, our firm‚Äôs first of its kind investment in the asset class.

Bitcoin is still a relatively high risk as an asset class and extremely volatile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to also discuss the risks and concerns that come with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies because Bitcoin is not a perfect solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bitcoin-woes--risks\"\u003eBitcoin Woes \u0026amp; Risks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"volatility\"\u003eVolatility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet‚Äôs talk about Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility first. As you might be aware, Bitcoin is highly volatile. Its price has fluctuated and more recently it‚Äôs lost 40% of its value since its last all-time high of $68,990 (around ¬£51,780) in November 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA store of value (often what Bitcoin is often referred to) does not lose 40% of its value in less than a year. If you had bought Bitcoin at this all-time high, it would be devastating to see that you‚Äôve lost 40% of your money in less than 6 months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat being said‚Ä¶volatility does bring opportunities. Looking at the longer term, Bitcoin has slowly been increasing in value over the last 12 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"bitcoin-price-history.png\" alt=\"Price chart for Bitcoin from 2009 to 2022.

There‚Äôs just still a lot we don‚Äôt know when it comes to what will happen to cryptocurrencies in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leads me to my next point now‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fighting-fomo-fear-of-missing-out\"\u003eFighting FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing I‚Äôve seen increase along with Bitcoin‚Äôs coverage in the media is the fear people have of feeling like they‚Äôre missing out. Which in turn causes them to panic buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without really understanding it and then panic selling when they see massive price swings, losing their money in the process. The news coverage around Bitcoin‚Äôs all-time high price tends to have this effect the most, and the people who buy Bitcoin at this all-time high and usually the first to get stung when Bitcoin tumbles down in price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think this issue can be summarised to just this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePeople get too emotional when it comes to any form of investments\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to other things, we‚Äôre generally a lot more level headed and reasonable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike, you wouldn‚Äôt panic-buy a new car because everyone else is buying that exact same car? Or what about a new phone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou‚Äôd probably want to do your research first, understand why these items are sought after and what they offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere‚Äôs another example. Over 2021, the \u003cem\u003eS\u0026amp;P 500 hit an all high 70 times throughout the year\u003c/em\u003e‚Ä¶how many times did you panic buy the S\u0026amp;P 500 during 2021?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most people reading this, they likely didn‚Äôt. Instead, they might have been fixated on what the media was saying about Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way I fight FOMO is by spending a lot of time researching and learning about what I want to invest in, all while ignoring the price of the asset while I do so. Depending on what I‚Äôm looking into, this process can take a few months and in the end, I might just decide not to invest in something because of something I found during my research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"replacing-traditional-currencies\"\u003eReplacing traditional currencies\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome folks that support Bitcoin see it as something that might replace traditional fiat currencies like the dollar and the pound sterling in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôll be honest‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think this will ever happen. No government would want to rely on a currency they are not in control of as their main currency. Fiat currencies in western nations also come with some level of protection on your money such as the FSCS protection scheme in the UK or the FDIC deposit insurance in the US. Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies as a whole) do not come with such protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother reason I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin replace traditional currencies is that cryptocurrencies exclude people who are not technologically literate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grandparents struggle using a smartphone, let alone mobile banking. I can‚Äôt see them ever getting crypto wallets and fully understanding the risks that come with it. I‚Äôm sure there are large groups of people who will likely struggle with cryptocurrencies due to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do however think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that offer ‚ÄòDeFi‚Äô (Decentralised Finance) will offer an alternative to traditional markets, and there is likely a future for that, but it won‚Äôt be replacing any traditional markets any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"energy-concerns\"\u003eEnergy concerns\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the biggest outcries you‚Äôll see around Bitcoin is its high energy usage. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail here but I will say that Bitcoin does use a lot of energy and that energy usage is only going to increase. That being said, however, I think people get Bitcoin‚Äôs energy consumption confused with its carbon emission output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt‚Äôs estimated that Bitcoin currently uses around 0.55% of global electricity production (roughly the equivalent amount of energy a small country uses). The exact percentage varies but it is suggested that a large amount of the energy used by Bitcoin miners is generated using renewable energy sources, hydropower being one of the largest sources of energy for Bitcoin. Using a renewable energy source will mean that there is minimal carbon output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther cryptocurrencies have found more energy-efficient ways of running their networks, one of such is \u003ca href=\"https://ethereum.org\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e which plans to move away from Proof of Work (what Bitcoin uses) to Proof of Stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin will likely not change how it works. It is designed to sacrifice electrical energy to generate/mine new bitcoins. This is its ‚Äòcost‚Äô of creating new bitcoins. Removing this ‚Äòcost‚Äô would also remove/reduce the value of Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs not really much I can add to this. I just wanted to point it out and make sure you were aware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"security\"\u003eSecurity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity plays a major part in cryptocurrencies.

Compound interest plays a large part in this and it can be hard to understand so let‚Äôs use a hypothetical example here to demonstrate this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet‚Äôs say Tom has ¬£10,000 and wants to grow this money over time. After a quick search online, Tom finds that the highest rate on an easy access savings account is 0.41%. If he left his money in this account for ten years and received the same interest rate over this time then Tom would have roughly ¬£10,417.65 after these ten years - He made a total of ¬£417.65 in interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let‚Äôs see what would happen if Tom invested this money instead. According to Goldman Sachs ‚Äú\u003ca href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-stock-market-return\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ethe average stock market return for 10 years is 9.2%, for the past 140 years.\u003c/a\u003e.‚Äù So we‚Äôll be using 9.2% as our yearly interest rate here (note - historical data is not an indicator of future performance) and imagine this is the rate Tom gets on his money over the next 10 years. At the end of these ten years, Tom would roughly have ¬£24,111.62! That‚Äôs a gain of ¬£14,111.62 and more than double what he started with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"dollar-duck.gif\" alt=\"donald duck dollar eyes gif\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCNBC Make It recently also put together a great video that demonstrates how powerful compound interest is.

Typically countries want the rate of inflation to be around 2% a year, to encourage spending, ensure stability and help plan for the future. \u003ca href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eThe Bank of England has a handy page\u003c/a\u003e that explains inflation and the downsides to both a higher rate of inflation and a lower rate of inflation.

Those gains you make can be \u003cstrong\u003e100% tax-free\u003c/strong\u003e - thanks to stocks and shares ISAs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet‚Äôs go back to the example with Tom before. If he invested his ¬£10,000 using a stocks and shares ISA and ended up with ¬£24,111.62, he could withdraw all of that from his ISA account (minus any fees) and not need to pay a penny in tax on that. If he had used a general investment account (GIA) then he‚Äôd need to pay some tax, specifically \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eCapital Gains Tax\u003c/a\u003e.

The value of your investments can go down as well as up so it‚Äôs highly recommended that you do not invest money that you need in the short term. It‚Äôs a good idea to have a few months worth of expenses at hand in an emergency fund so you don‚Äôt need to dip into the money you‚Äôve already invested and possibly get back less than what you started with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"risks-\"\u003eRisks ‚ö†Ô∏è\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile investing can boost the amount of money you have, it isn‚Äôt all smooth sailing.

The idea is very simple - You give them your money and they do all the investing work for you. It‚Äôs basically automated investing. There are groups of people that might have a limited amount of free time, so this would be great as it gives them a chance to invest without spending large amounts of their time trying to learn how to invest.

If you‚Äôre someone that specifically wants to choose what you invest in, then this method likely won‚Äôt be for you. Additionally, having to manage the investments for thousands (if not millions) of people is not easy. Investment firms will charge a fee for these services. The fees are relatively small but over time they can compound to thousands of pounds as your portfolio grows in size - Just something to bear in mind üêª\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings us to the more hands-on approach to investing\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"do-it-yourself-platforms--brokers-\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;Do it yourself\u0026rdquo; platforms \u0026amp; brokers üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the name suggests, if you open your account with a do it yourself investment firm you‚Äôll need to pick what to invest in by yourself.

If you‚Äôre planning on holding investments like ETFs in the long term (like I am) then this approach can be a lot cheaper - A ‚Äòdo it for me‚Äô firm might charge around 0.75% for managing your money for you, but some ETFs can have even lower charges (e.g. some ETFs have an ongoing charge of 0.07% or even less - That‚Äôs just over ten times less than the ‚Äòdo it for me‚Äô ongoing charge I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"exchange-traded-funds-etfs-\"\u003eExchange Traded Funds (ETFs) ü•ß\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can be hard to know exactly what to invest in and that‚Äôs why I think ETFs are great for the majority of everyday retail investors.

That ‚Äòsomething‚Äô can be anything from an index, a sector, a group of assets (e.g. green enegry companies) or some other type of asset. An ETF can be made up of many assets and by buying an ETF you‚Äôre essentially buying a small piece of all the assets it is made up of. Some of the biggest ETF providers include \u003ca href=\"https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eVanguard\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ishares.com/uk\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eiShares\u003c/a\u003e by Blackrock and \u003ca href=\"https://www.invesco.co.uk/uk\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eInvesco\u003c/a\u003e, but there are many more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere‚Äôs a simpler way of thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine you have five different bags of sweets. Now you want each type of sweet but you don‚Äôt want to buy all five bags - maybe it\u0026rsquo;s too expensive or you don\u0026rsquo;t want to buy that many sweets. We can imagine these bags of sweets as shares of different companies. You then come across a variety bag of sweets, that contains a mix of sweets from each of those five bags. Buying this one bag of sweets gets you a bit of each of the sweets from those five bags without needing to buy all five bags of sweets. We can think of the variety bag of sweets as an ETF - an easier and cheaper way of buying all the different types of sweets in smaller amounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, when most people talk about ETFs, they are usually talking about passive ETFs that have lower fees and are not managed by an asset manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActively managed funds/ETFs on the other hand usually charge higher fees than passive ETF funds to hire a manager that picks stocks they believe will achieve a higher return however this isn‚Äôt guaranteed and \u003ca href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/why-index-funds-beat-actively-managed-funds-2466411\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ehistorically passive funds have a strong history of beating actively managed funds\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to being low cost, ETFs have another great advantage to them - automatic risk diversification. If one company within an ETF loses a lot of value or even goes bust, it‚Äôs a lot less risky for you as your money is spread out across several other companies/assets within the ETF instead of being all in that one company that went bust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can read more about different types of ETFs \u003ca href=\"https://freetrade.io/learn/what-is-an-etf\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e (Freetrade does a great job explaining them further).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary-\"\u003eSummary üìù\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is quite a lengthy read, so let me summarise the above into some bullet points:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInvesting is a great way of growing your money and beating the rate of inflation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStocks are Shares ISAs help you pay less or no Capital Gains Tax\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHave an emergency fund before investing any money\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePick your approach to investing\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRide out market volatility with low-cost passive ETFs and invest with the long term in mind\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInvesting can be easy\u003c/strong\u003e, and believe it or not, if you‚Äôre of working age and are currently employed, you likely already have an investment account without realising it - your workplace pension!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI highly recommend looking into investing or just learning more about it, because the best time to invest was yesterday, the second-best time is today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whats-coming-next-\"\u003eWhat‚Äôs coming next ‚û°Ô∏è\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo lockdown is coming to an end soon and with that, a lot of people‚Äôs schedules are changing, including mine.

From what I‚Äôve found, no other savings/investment account is as generous as a UK ISA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the US, IRA and Roth IRA and the closest thing to an ISA. Any money that goes into either one of these accounts (you can only have one or the other) can‚Äôt be accessed until after the age of 59 and a half. With a UK ISA, you have the freedom to withdraw your money at any time you like. With an IRA you also have to pay income tax on any withdrawals you make as well as some penalties if you make a withdrawal before the age of 59 and a half and this is really where the UK ISA shines in comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a UK ISA, you can make a withdrawal at any time (for the cash ISA and stocks and shares ISA) within a penalty - Perfect for if you‚Äôre planning on using the money for a large purchase (e.g. a home) or if you‚Äôre looking to retire before the state age of retirement. Other countries offer similar accounts to what the US offers and from what I could find online which only highlights the uniqueness of UK ISAs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething to bear in mind is the limit on how much you can invest into ISAs each tax year and currently, that‚Äôs ¬£20,000. This is why I think ‚Äòremembering to use your ISA limit‚Äô isn‚Äôt beneficial to most people unless you can put away the full ¬£20,000 each tax year (¬£1667 each month) into your ISA. If you are in a position where you‚Äôre able to put away ¬£20,000 then it might be worth considering using up your allowance as it‚Äôs not possible to rollover any unused allowance from a previous tax year into the current or future tax years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis limit can be split across several different types of ISA‚Äôs and it‚Äôs important to remember that \u003cstrong\u003eyou can only contribute money to one type of ISA in each tax year\u003c/strong\u003e (e.g. you can contribute ¬£5,000 into a cash ISA and ¬£15,000 into a stocks and shares ISA in one tax year).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how many ISAs are there and do you need all of them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-isas-and-my-thoughts-around-them-\"\u003eTypes of ISAs (and my thoughts around them) ‚ú®\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are five ISA types currently - cash ISAs, stocks and shares ISAs, the lifetime ISAs, innovative finance ISAs and Junior ISAs.The three most common ones for people over the age of 18 are the cash ISA, the stocks and shares ISA and the lifetime ISA, so let‚Äôs cover those three first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBear in mind, the following comments on each type are just my thoughts and opinions of each of these ISAs and this isn‚Äôt financial advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cash-isas-\"\u003eCash ISAs üí∑\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCash ISA‚Äôs are the simplest and most risk-free type of ISA - You can think of it like a normal savings account. The difference is that with a saving account, you‚Äôll have to pay tax on any interest you earn that is over your personal saving allowance (¬£1,000 in interest for basic rate taxpayers, ¬£500 for higher-rate taxpayers). With a cash ISA, you pay no tax on any interest regardless of your personal saving allowance. In my personal opinion, this isn‚Äôt as great as it sounds. Let me explain why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the time of writing this newsletter issue, the highest interest rate for a fixed term ISA was around 1% and can only be obtained if you lock up your money in this ISA for several years. The rates for flexible or easy access cash ISAs are a lot lower and range around 0.4% to 0.5%. If we consider these rates then you would need to have saved between ¬£100,000 to ¬£250,000 to earn enough interest to go over your personal saving allowance (assuming you are a basic rate taxpayer) with these ISAs and reaching these amounts will take years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to this, you‚Äôll also need to consider the price of inflation - Any interest rate lower than the rate of inflation means that in the long term, your money is losing value rather than gaining any. You can find the current rate of inflation on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eOffice for National Statistics website\u003c/a\u003e and as of January 2021, it stands at 0.9%. A majority of the time, you‚Äôll find that almost all (especially for instant/easy access cash ISAs) that the rates offered by cash ISA providers are below this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my opinion, this makes the cash ISA a terrible way of growing your money in the long term and it makes more sense to use a normal saving account for short term savings or an emergency fund instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"lifetime-isas-\"\u003eLifetime ISAs üè°\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifetime ISA‚Äôs are slightly different to other ISAs - The maximum amount of money you can put in a lifetime ISA is capped at ¬£4,000 per tax year but the benefit is that for every ¬£4 you put into the account, you get a ¬£1 bonus from the government up to a maximum of ¬£1,000 per tax year. This ISA was introduced in 2017 to replace the Help to Buy ISA and can be opened by anyone between the ages of 18 to 39. It has two purposes - to help savers save enough to buy their first home or it can be withdrawn as cash for your retirement (at retirement age that is).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you open a Lifetime ISA at the age of 18 and made the maximum contribution until you were 50 then you would receive a maximum bonus of ¬£33,000. A lot of home buyer will likely want to purchase a home before the age of 50, so the bonus received will depend on how much is saved in this ISA as well as how many years you decide to save for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a great ISA if you are planning on buying a home soon (or for retirement in the long term) and it comes in two flavours - cash lifetime ISAs and stocks and shares lifetime ISAs. Additionally, you can contribute to this ISA and another cash or lifetime ISA regardless of the type of lifetime ISA you pick. Just know that with stocks and shares lifetime ISAs there are usually some additional fees such as platform charges and charges per trade (if you decided to pick your own stocks and shares for your lifetime ISA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you‚Äôre planning on buying a home in the short term and you plan on saving more than ¬£4,000 a year, you could use a lifetime ISA in combination with another type of ISA to save up more tax-free (but as mentioned, I personally wouldn‚Äôt choose a cash ISA).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are looking to buy a home in the more long term (e.g. five-plus years), then you could save using your lifetime ISA (either cash or stocks or shares) with a stocks and shares ISA to grow your money over time. Just be aware that stocks and shares ISAs come with the risk of the value of your investments going down as well as up so it‚Äôs generally advised not to use them if you are not comfortable taking risks or if you need access to the money in the short term. This brings me to the next type of ISA\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"stocks-and-shares-isas-\"\u003eStocks and Shares ISAs üìà\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the name implies, you‚Äôll be able to use the money you put into a stocks and shares ISA to buy‚Ä¶.stocks and shares. There are two variations of this ISA - the automated option (or ‚Äúdo it for me‚Äù) or the ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù option. The automated option is great if you don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time research funds and stocks that you want to invest in. It‚Äôs all taken care of for you, but it comes at a cost\u0026hellip;literally. From what I‚Äôve seen, the fees on accounts that take care of investing your money for you generally are a bit higher than do it yourself options. That however doesn‚Äôt make ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù options better - They can have their own fees as well depending on who provides them. Some platforms have low fees (e.g. Freetrade and Trading212) and other platforms charge per trade you make (on average around ¬£9.99 per trade) so that‚Äôs something else you‚Äôll also need to take into consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my favourite type of ISA because it‚Äôs possible to beat the rate of inflation while also growing your savings further. Regardless of which type of stocks and shares ISA you get, you‚Äôll want to avoid high fees as much as possible. Fees like this will eat into any gains you make and in the long term it can stack up quite a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis ISA is better suited for long term savings/investing due to the risk that comes with it as stocks and shares can go up or down in value in a short period of time. I‚Äôve gone with a ‚Äúdo it yourself‚Äù stocks and shares ISA myself and plan on investing in low-cost ETFs and a small handful of growth stocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before someone asks, no \u003cstrong\u003eyou cannot buy cryptocurrencies within an ISA\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"innovative-finance-isas-\"\u003eInnovative Finance ISAs üí•\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôll be honest\u0026hellip;this is the ISA I know the \u003cem\u003eleast\u003c/em\u003e about. This ISA is mainly offered by Peer to Peer (P2P) lender, and what I can tell you is that if you use an innovative finance ISA, your money will be used for peer to peer loans, making you a private lender rather than an investor like you would be with a stocks and shares ISA. The risks are also quite different; borrowers can default on their loans and your money isn‚Äôt even protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) like it is with the other types of ISAs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, no FSCS protection makes this a major no for me and there‚Äôs not much else I have to say about this ISA üò¨\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"junior-isas-\"\u003eJunior ISAs üë∂\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you‚Äôre over the age of 18 then unfortunately you won‚Äôt be able to open a Junior ISA. However, if you are a parent and wanted to put some money aside for your child/children for later on in life, then a Junior ISA could be great. Compound interest will work in their favour and depending on how soon you open an account for them, they can stand to benefit from up to 18 years of compounding interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJunior ISAs come in two flavours - cash ISAs and stocks and shares ISAs. Generally speaking, the interest rates on a cash Junior ISA are higher than what you can find with a normal savings account or a cash ISA. The stocks and shares ISAs variant can also be great as you‚Äôll have up to 18 years to allow that money to compound over time and investing can outperform cash when it comes to long periods of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are the downsides then? Well, the first is you can‚Äôt withdraw any money put into a junior ISA, only your child can and they can only do that once they turn 18. Additionally, the amount of money you can put into a junior ISA is capped at ¬£9,000 per tax year at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, that‚Äôs all my thoughts around these types of ISAs summarised as best as I can. I could probably still go on quite a bit about all this but I hope this gives you a general idea of why ISAs could be beneficial for you if you don‚Äôt already have one. If you wanted to go further down the rabbit hole of the world of ISA‚Äôs then there are many resources you can check out but my first stop and recommendation would be to check out the \u003ca href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eMoney Saving Expert\u003c/a\u003e website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee ya next time! ü¶Ä\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"mr-krabs.gif\" alt=\"Mr Krabs money shower gif\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"

So what do you do to prevent an outage from interrupting your life (and your access to money)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR - Spread your money across a few bank accounts (and card networks)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"multiple-bank-accounts\"\u003eMultiple bank accounts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt‚Äôs rare for a bank to have an outage but if and when they do and you need access to your money, you‚Äôll want a backup account for such a situation. The majority of current accounts are free and a few banks let you open an online current account within less than an hour. I think it‚Äôs a great idea to open up a second bank account and hold a few days worth of spending money in it or at least enough to cover any recurring bills you might have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother thing you might want to do instead would be to split your \u003ca href=\"/archive/akashandmoney/emergency-funds/\" \u003eemergency fund\u003c/a\u003e  across two or three bank accounts, to ensure you always have access to some money regardless of if your main bank has an outage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of outages that have happened in the past:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTSB, 2018 - \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/06/timeline-of-trouble-how-the-tsb-it-meltdown-unfolded\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eoutage for multiple weeks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNatwest \u0026amp; RBS, 2019 - \u003ca href=\"https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/34871/natwest-and-rbs-down-infuriating-black-friday-online-shoppers\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eoutage on Black Friday\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRevolut, 2019 - \u003ca href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220928011612/https://blog.revolut.com/revolut-app-issues-30th-october-what-happened-and-what-we-did-to-fix-it/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eoutage for two and a half hours\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMonzo, 2019 - \u003ca href=\"https://monzo.com/blog/2019/09/08/why-monzo-wasnt-working-on-july-29th\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eoutage for two hours\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of how long an outage is for, not having access to your money is a horrible feeling. While it‚Äôs impossible to know when a bank could have an outage, by being prepared with a backup account, you can be reassured that you‚Äôll have access to some of your money until the outage with your main bank has been resolved.\nThere‚Äôs just one other thing to consider as well when looking into secondary accounts, because‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"card-networks-have-outages-as-well-\"\u003eCard networks have outages as well üôÉ\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"spongebob-fire.gif\" alt=\"spongebob fire gif\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup. This is something else you‚Äôll also need to consider. If you look at any bank card, you‚Äôll likely see either a Mastercard, Visa or an American Express logo somewhere on it. These are all card networks that work independently of each other and several banks will be using one or the other for their debit and credit cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018 Visa has an outage that caused \u003ca href=\"https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/32277/visa-says-52m-payments-failed-during-10-hour-outage\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003e5.2 million payments to fail during a 10-hour outage\u003c/a\u003e and 2.4 million of those payments were in the UK üò¨\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn that day, Mastercard and American Express cardholders were able to continue using their cards without any major issues. So having a bank card on another card network to your main bank account might just help you out in a tricky situation like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain - This type of outage isn\u0026rsquo;t even that common, but making sure you are ready for it just means you have one less thing to worry about in the future in the chance that an outage does occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, the important thing to remember is not to panic when an outage happens and fall back on your other bank account (hopefully also on another card network).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the future, we‚Äôre likely going to progress into an increasingly more digital financial world. In 2019 alone, more than half of the payments made in the UK were made via a card and in 2020 this trend only accelerated due to the pandemic and increased contactless spending limit in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a last resort, you could also just have a little bit of cash on hand in such situations (as long as you‚Äôre not tempted to spend it).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having access to your main account (or any money) can be annoying.

In 2018, Money Saving Expert found that \u003cem\u003efour million mobile phone users are paying up to ¬£38 extra for their phones/contracts\u003c/em\u003e without realising it and it‚Äôs partly to do it with how fixed contact deals work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of a contact, most network providers will roll you onto a 30-day plan where everything stays the same including the price. This isn‚Äôt great because fixed-term contracts include the price of the phone in the plan. At the end of the term, you‚Äôd have paid the phone off but by not changing your plan you could still end up paying for a phone you‚Äôve already paid off üò±\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, a handful of network providers have committed to moving customers to lower-priced plans at the end of a contract term automatically to save them some money however, some network providers (\u003cem\u003ecough cough\u003c/em\u003e, Three, EE and Vodafone üôÑ) have declined to offer this, leaving it up to customers to remember switching to a cheaper deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the tips I‚Äôve previously discussed on how to \u003ca href=\"/archive/akashandmoney/busting-broadband-bills\" \u003ehaggle with your broadband provider\u003c/a\u003e with network providers as well if you want to stay with the same one at the end of your contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I buy my phone outright while sticking to sim only plans and hang onto my phone for three to four years before replacing it.

Another great benefit of virtual networks is that a lot of the sim only plans offer flexibility. They are mostly 30-day sim plans which give you the freedom to switch to a better deal later on if you wanted.

Traditional computer software, apps on our phones and even video games (to some degree) are all turning into monthly subscription services. Subscriptions are great for companies that build software. It creates a recurring and predictable source of revenue that can be reinvested to build better products and services, however it might leave you with less money and a sense of obligation to use these services to \u003cem\u003eget your money‚Äôs worth\u003c/em\u003e from them since you‚Äôve already paid for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can make sense to pay a subscription for great software but as a rule of thumb, I try to stick to only those that I‚Äôm able to get a lot of value out of or ones that help save me time such as my \u003ca href=\"https://1password.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003epassword manager\u003c/a\u003e, my music streaming service, \u003ca href=\"https://www.spotify.com/uk/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e and most recently \u003ca href=\"https://readwise.io/i/akash56\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eReadwise\u003c/a\u003e for tracking and syncing various notes and highlight across several sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost software subscriptions can be considered as ‚Äò\u003cem\u003eoptional\u003c/em\u003e‚Äô subscriptions.

As with software subscriptions, the same rule applies - Only keep the ones that prove to provide you value but also try not to be subscribed to different versions of the same type of service - You probably don‚Äôt need a subscription to two or more streaming services for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"classic-subscriptions\"\u003eClassic subscriptions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFixed monthly costs can be thought of being subscriptions as well - You pay monthly for a service or product. So energy, internet, phone and rent/mortgage bills are what I would consider ‚Äòclassic subscriptions‚Äô. Instead of cutting these ones out, there are usually ways you could cut down on some of them which can end up saving you money. It could be as simple as checking if you are \u003ca href=\"https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/08/third-of-mobile-network-customers-still-being-hit-by-overpayments-rip-off/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eoverpaying for your phone plan\u003c/a\u003e, switching to a cheaper energy supplier, or \u003ca href=\"/archive/akashandmoney/busting-broadband-bills\" \u003ehaggling with your broadband provider for a cheaper deal\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"keeping-a-track-on-subscriptions\"\u003eKeeping a track on subscriptions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can easily fall for the trap of needing every subscription service thrown at us and also losing track of what we are subscribed to. I found it useful to track each of these subscriptions and how much they are costing me each month/year.

Out of all the personal finance books that I have read, I think this one that I found the most interesting, because despite the different time period, a lot of the things covered in the story of this book about the ancient and forgotten city are still relevant and the personal finance concepts explained can still be applied to how we treat our finances today.

I have however learnt to limit buying things that leave both me and my bank balance happy - It\u0026rsquo;s all about finding that perfect balance. This all ties back to what I discussed above about minimalism. While I\u0026rsquo;m not committing to a fully minimalist lifestyle, by thinking more about what I spend my money on I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to cut down overspending and learnt to value quality over quantity when it comes to possessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-video-that-inspired-this-issue\"\u003eThe video that inspired this issue\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0026rsquo;t lie, this issue is heavily inspired by a recent video I came across on YouTube. I found it to be really engaging, easy to understand and well put together. It made my stop and think about my relationship with things and money.

If you happen to be someone that carries a credit card balance month to month, then earning points should be a low priority and instead, you should focus on paying down this debt or any other short term debt you may have - **The points earned do not outweigh the interest rate of any debit so please bear that in mind. **\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, but what‚Äôs the point of points? (see what I did there üòè)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"credit-card-rewardspoints\"\u003eCredit card rewards/points\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, let\u0026rsquo;s kick-off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever you make a transaction using either cash or a card, most cards do not offer you anything at all for making those transactions. Reward credit cards offer a reward for using them instead of your other payment options where you usually earn a point per ¬£1 you spend on the card. If you look back at how much you spent month to month, you can roughly work out the number of points you could be earning on your purchases and these points can stack up over several years and be used on things like flights, cash back or credit statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last three years, I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to collect just over 70,000 points across American Express Membership Reward Points, British Airways Avios and Virgin Points. Most credit cards also offer a signup bonus with a few thousand points to start with either if you hit a spending goal or by making a single transaction on the card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"being-responsible-with-credit-cards\"\u003eBeing responsible with credit cards\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow earning rewards is great but you\u0026rsquo;ll tend to find that credit cards like this tend to have a higher interest rate than other credit cards. If you end up carrying a balance because you\u0026rsquo;re unable to pay off a credit card in full each month, then the points end up costing you more than what they are worth. It can be really easy to justify a frivolous purchase because \u0026ldquo;I can pay it off after I get paid\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s this type of mentality can make it a lot harder to budget and can lead to overspending money you might not have. This is why I use a feature from my main bank and carefully plan my spending to overcome this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"welcome-bonuses\"\u003eWelcome bonuses\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore signing up for any of these credit cards, the first thing I did was see if I had any planned large purchases coming up. Reward credit cards often tend to have a \u003cstrong\u003ewelcome bonus\u003c/strong\u003e but the catch is that you only get the bonus once you spend a certain amount on the credit card. For one of my cards, the bonus was an extra 5,000 points when you spent ¬£2,000 within the first three months. Around the time of getting my first rewards card, I was looking to purchase a new phone for my mum and book a return trip flight for my family. Together these purchases were over ¬£2,000 and they were all going to be made in the next three months so I signed up for a credit card and managed to hit the spending goal for the bonus without spending more than I was already planning to spend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first mistakes you can make when signing up for these credit cards is \u003cem\u003ethinking you need to hit the spending goal for the bonus\u003c/em\u003e, which again, leads to overspending. By strategically planning your spending you can avoid this entirely and just spend the amount you were already planning on spending. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any large purchases coming up just yet then it might be a good idea to hold off from signing up for a rewards credit card if you want the welcome bonus (hint - you should want the bonus).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, you can sometimes get a slightly bigger signup bonus by using a referral link to sign up for one of these credit cards. The extra bonus points vary per card but for example, the referral bonus for the Amex rewards credit card is 6,000 Membership Reward points (1,000 extra) and 22,000 Membership Reward points for the Amex gold card (2,000 extra). The referrer also gets some extra points as an incentive. I‚Äôd recommend asking any of your friends and family first to see if they have a referral link and if not you can always email myself for one as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"amex-rewards-card-welcome-bonus.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the American Express website showing the welcome bonus offer on The American Express Rewards Credit Card\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e^ An example of a referral welcome bonus on the American Express Rewards Credit Card\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"paying-off-credit-cards\"\u003ePaying off credit cards\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I do is treat my credit cards like debit cards. If I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough in my current account to pay for something then I can\u0026rsquo;t buy it via a credit card. The other thing I do is pay my credit cards off in full each month. I do this by setting up a direct debit for each card linked to my bank account. Monzo has a unique feature where you can pay your direct debits from pots which I use to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing this feature I set up a pot for each credit card and link the direct debit to them. Now, when I do pay for things on my credit card I\u0026rsquo;ve got into a habit of moving the exact amount of money from my main account over to my credit card pot. Then, when the direct debit is due, the money is withdrawn from the pot and used to pay the direct debit automatically. Using this, I can stick to my budget and also reap the benefits from credit cards without overspending since the money needs to be in my account first to be moved over to the pot to pay off the credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"monzo-amex-pot.jpeg\" alt=\"Screenshot of a Monzo pot name \u0026lsquo;Amex - Rewards Card\u0026rsquo; with an American Express direct debit linked to it\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e^ The pot I set up to pay my American Express Rewards Credit Card direct debit\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fees\"\u003eFees\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first fee you want to avoid is the interest rate. You can avoid this by simply paying your balance in full every money. The method I use above is my preferred way and I highly recommend setting up a direct debit to have the balance paid off in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are often other fees as well for making transactions using reward cards abroad and for making withdrawals at ATMs. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest avoiding using credit cards for these types of transactions and instead, use a fee-free debit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-credit-cards\"\u003eMy credit cards\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years I\u0026rsquo;ve had a number of credit cards. At the moment I currently have three point-earning cards that I use for my day to day spending. Between these three cards, I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to rack up over 70,000 points across them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"american-express-rewards-credit-card\"\u003eAmerican Express Rewards Credit Card\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first, and the main credit card that I use is the \u003ca href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/credit-cards/rewards-credit-card/?linknav=uk-amex-cardshop-allcards-learn-RewardsCreditCard-carousel\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eAmerican Express Rewards Credit Card\u003c/a\u003e. It has no annual fee and earns 1 Membership Rewards point per ¬£1 spent on the card. These points are the most versatile out of the three types I collect. There are a lot of different ways you can spend them such as a credit statement on your credit card bill, gift vouchers (e.g. Amazon) or (and my favourite) airline air miles across a number of airlines. These points never expire as long as you keep a Membership Rewards point earning card open. To date, I hold just over 40,000 Membership Rewards points on my card and I don\u0026rsquo;t plan on using them just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"british-airways-american-express-credit-card\"\u003eBritish Airways American Express Credit Card\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Amex rewards credit card was available in the UK I actually used the \u003ca href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/credit-cards/ba-credit-card/?linknav=uk-amex-cardshop-allcards-learn-BritAirwaysAmexCC-carousel\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eBritish Airways Credit Card\u003c/a\u003e for most of my day to day spending. This card also has no annual fee and at the time of when I got my BA (British Airways) Amex card I just used to collect Avios air miles (1 point per ¬£1 spent) in the hopes of using these air miles for business class flights. Head for Points is a great website that explains \u003ca href=\"https://www.headforpoints.com/the-beginners-guide-to-collecting-avios-points/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ehow to earn Avios\u003c/a\u003e as well as \u003ca href=\"https://www.headforpoints.com/2020/04/06/how-do-you-book-flights-using-avios-points/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ewhat you can spend them on\u003c/a\u003e.\nThere is one issue with collecting just Avios points and it\u0026rsquo;s that \u003ca href=\"https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/executive-club/collecting-avios/avios-expiry-rules\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ethey expire if you do not collect, spend, purchase or share at least one Avios point\u003c/a\u003e every 36 months. This isn\u0026rsquo;t too terrible, however, it can be easy to forget and you could end up losing all your Avios air miles.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I have one monthly card subscription paid from my BA credit card and this keeps my 25,000 plus Avios air miles valid indefinitely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"virgin-atlantic-credit-card\"\u003eVirgin Atlantic Credit Card\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy final main credit card is the \u003ca href=\"https://uk.virginmoney.com/cards/products/vaa-cards/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eVirgin Atlantic Credit Card\u003c/a\u003e. This Mastercard credit card has no annual fee but earns a slightly lower rate of 0.75 points per ¬£1 spent and 1.5 points for every ¬£1 spent via Virgin Atlantic or Virgin Holidays. I treat this card more as a backup card for places that don\u0026rsquo;t accept American Express. This is one of my most recent cards and a card I do not use that often, so I only have just over 5,000 points on this card - 5,000 of those points coming from the signup bonus before that was removed earlier this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-i-would-do-differently\"\u003eWhat I would do differently\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could start all over again the main change I would make is signing up for the \u003ca href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/credit-cards/gold-credit-card/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eAmex Preferred Rewards Gold Credit Card\u003c/a\u003e first via a referral link to get a welcome bonus of 22,000 points instead of the Amex rewards credit card. You pay no annual fee for the first year you have an Amex gold card, so towards the end of that year, if I didn\u0026rsquo;t find myself utilising the other benefits that came with the gold card I would downgrade to the rewards card to retain all the points I earned and to keep earning more points while still paying no annual fee. \u003ca href=\"https://thepointsguy.co.uk/guide/beginners-guide-tpg-uk/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eThe Points Guy\u0026amp;rsquo;s Beginner Guide\u003c/a\u003e is also a great resource for learning how to maximise the most out of reward credit cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s all for this issue, I hope it was informative and insightful around how reward credit cards work! If you would like a referral for one of American Express cards I mentioned and you aren\u0026rsquo;t able to use anyone else\u0026rsquo;s referral first, you can email me and I can share mine with you üòä\u003c/p\u003e\n"

Credit scores are used by lenders as a way to measure your \u0026ldquo;reliability\u0026rdquo; when they decide if you can qualify for certain lending products (e.g. credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLenders want to avoid lending money to people that they think are unlikely to pay it back. If your credit score is on the low side, they could flat out reject your application or they might consider you for their products but with a higher interest rate, which means you end up needing to pay back more than those with a higher credit score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all credit scores are the same, and lenders do not use the same one. You have three different credit scores in the UK due to the three credit agencies in the UK; \u003cstrong\u003eExperian\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003eEquifax\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eTransUnion\u003c/strong\u003e. These three agencies provide your credit report to lenders to help them make accurate decisions regarding their lending products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-three-agencies\"\u003eThe three agencies\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of misunderstanding around how credit scores work and several \u003ca href=\"https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/faqs/credit-myths/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003erumours and myths\u003c/a\u003e as well which have scared people into not checking their credit score.

This shows lenders that I was able to pay a bill on time and with no issues for the length of time that I had this bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"registering-on-the-electoral-roll-\"\u003eRegistering on the electoral roll üó≥\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also registered to vote a few years before this. Something you might not know is that you can register to vote at the age of 16! If you haven\u0026rsquo;t you can do this on the government website via \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ethis link\u003c/a\u003e which takes roughly 5 minutes and provides another positive impact on your credit score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"getting-a-credit-card-\"\u003eGetting a credit card üí≥\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOk, this option isn\u0026rsquo;t for everyone - Some people might just want to avoid credit cards but if you end up taking one up, using it a bit, and pay it off in full on time every month then again this shows lenders that you are reliable. I got offered a student credit card with a ¬£500 limit along with my student bank account and honestly, for most of the first year, I forgot I even had it. I started using it a bit more after that, putting roughly ¬£50 a month of my spending on it and paying that off in full each month. By doing this I also maintained a \u003cem\u003elow utilisation\u003c/em\u003e of my credit limit by keeping my credit usage at around 30% or less of my limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three of these things when combined gave lenders a good understanding of how I managed my money and brought up my score without really doing much. These led to being accepted for other lending products like my American Express credit cards and an overdraft (the latter being something I don\u0026rsquo;t use and only really have for an emergency), which further builds a clearer picture of my credit history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a good credit score and credit history can help you secure a better interest rate (remember where we talked about measuring reliability) for large loans such as a mortgage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChecking your score also helps you spot anything fishy on your account, such as a credit card you never took out - Using these same services you can usually report something like this and they\u0026rsquo;ll be able to investigate things like that for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s all for this email and I hope that this is a great introduction to credit scores for you. In the next issue, I\u0026rsquo;ll go over \u003ca href=\"/archive/akashandmoney/credit-card-connoisseur\" \u003ecredit cards\u003c/a\u003e and how I use mine to get a ton of points, air miles and cashback without paying anything extra fees or costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eHey üëã\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong time no see! First of all apologies for this reaching you a week later than it should have, I was a bit busy settling into \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/akashgoswami_/status/1316723658455478273\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003emy new role at work\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this issue, I wanted to cover social media and how scammers have been using it to their advantage. Social media is great, it has allowed us to connect to friends and family globally through a trying year. Unfortunately, it has also made it a lot easier for fraudsters to find people to deceive and steal their money via these same platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn‚Äôt a topic strictly related to personal finance, but I‚Äôve always believed that knowing how to protect your money from these common scams is something that should be more widely known. By working for a bank, I‚Äôve come across a number of these scams before. I wanted to break down the three most common ones you‚Äôll find on social media at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"advance-fee-scams-\"\u003eAdvance Fee Scams üí∏\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you remember at the start of the lockdown how \u003ca href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/02/nintendo-switch-animal-crossing-and-coronavirus-led-to-record-sales.html\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eeveryone wanted to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of people were told to stay at home and finding something to do to pass the time led to many exploring what video games had to offer. Combined with a supply issue for new consoles such as the Nintendo Switch, scammers used this shortage of consoles to their advantage. There was a flood of people looking to sell their games consoles, bikes, shoes and more through several different ways using the lockdown. eBay, Depop, Shpock, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook Marketplace are just a handful of the platforms used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScammers will list items up for sale among legitimate items regardless of if they have the item or not - It is easy to find someone else‚Äôs photos and use those instead as a part of their scams! All they need to do is wait for someone to contact them about the item they have for ‚Äòsale‚Äô after posting the listing. Once someone falls for the bait, the social engineering begins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are not familiar with the term social engineering I‚Äôll provide a brief explanation. \u003cstrong\u003eSocial engineering\u003c/strong\u003e is the act of manipulating someone into doing a task or action, such as sending a bank transfer or sharing their login details for certain websites. This is a crucial part of the scam as most of relying heavily on the use of social engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this scam, a buyer will usually be convinced to send a bank transfer and have the goods (e.g. a Nintendo Switch sent to them). What will happen is as soon as the scammer has received the money, they‚Äôll simply move this to another account or withdraw it as cash at an ATM and then block the person they were speaking to. Worse, they might string the buyer along for a few days buying they more time to move the money while telling the buyer that they have \u0026lsquo;sent the item\u0026rsquo;, before later again blocking them. Ok, but where‚Äôs the social engineering element?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the payment is made, this will be the point where the scammer will try everything to convince someone to send them a payment. This can be in the form of showing additional photos of the item, telling them they live too far away from the buyer to meet face to face to sell the item or just telling the buyer to \u0026rsquo;trust them because they are not a scammer\u0026rsquo;\u0026hellip;\nIt is also the point where if asked if the payment can be sent via a more secure method (such as the PayPal Goods \u0026amp; Services option) that the scammer will either say to the buyer to either send the payment via the ‚ÄòFriends and Family‚Äô option, via bank transfer or simply say that they do not have a PayPal account. This again is preying on the fact that a lot of people do not understand the difference between the two options on PayPal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayPal‚Äôs Goods \u0026amp; Service option will offer a form of buyer/fraud protection and they charge a small amount of commission on the final sale value to provide this service. The friends and family option offers no such protection and thus does not charge a fee. If you end up buying an item via this way and it later turns out to be a scam, PayPal is unlikely to help you with this as they\u0026rsquo;ll state that the friends and family option is not meant to be used for buying goods and services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best way to avoid getting scammed over items like this over the internet is to either see the item first face to face with the seller before making the payment or using a platform (such as eBay, Depop, Shpock, etc.) that offers the ability to make your purchase via their payment platform (or via your bank details).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a seller on these platforms tell you that their account is ‚Äònot working‚Äô or is ‚Äòunable to receive‚Äô payments (commonly seen on Depop for example) it‚Äôs best to see this as a red flag to not continue with the purchase as they will try to redirect you to make the payment via a method that will give you no buyer/fraud protection and ultimately a higher chance that you will be scammed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"depop_chat_reddit.png\" alt=\"A screenshot from a Depop chat which is highly likely to be a scam via that I found on Reddit\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eA screenshot from a Depop chat which is highly likely to be a scam via that I found on \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Depop/comments/dxa4rh/is_this_a_scam_if_i_pay_through_paypal_can_i/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eReddit\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn‚Äôt look to buy via such methods and always look to make a payment using my card details via a payment portal/checkout provided by the app/platform for better protection. There‚Äôs a higher risk of purchases made via bank transfers (or PayPal friends and family) being a scam and if you end up sending money via these ways, it can be very difficult to recover any of the money sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"investment-scams-\"\u003eInvestment Scams üìà\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis scam is also a common one but comes in many forms. The concept largely remains the same - Send the scammer some money and they promise to send you more money back. \u003ca href=\"https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/alert/164-instagram-users-report-losing-over-350000-to-investment-scams\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eAction Fraud found that 164 Instagram users reported that they had collectively lost over ¬£350,000\u003c/a\u003e and that‚Äôs just from reported cases. The real amount lost is a lot higher as most of these types of scams go unreported due to victims not really being sure who to report these to or simply out of embarrassment of being scammed in the first place. \u003ca href=\"https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/36432/barclays-reports-66-spike-in-scams\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eBarclays has seen a 66% spike in scams\u003c/a\u003e in the first six months of the year with July seeing a 49% increase in the volume of investment scams. So how does this scam work and who is it that falls for them?\nLet‚Äôs first discuss how the scam works. Similar to Advance Fee scams, scammers will create social media profiles and then will post many photos and attempt to gain as many followers as possible to ‚Äòbuild their brand‚Äô. The photos posted will be a glimpse of their \u0026rsquo;luxury lifestyle\u0026rsquo; - big houses, swimming pools, fancy cars, travel snaps, parties and often stacks of money to entice people into wanting a similar lifestyle. They‚Äôll also usually hide their face or could go a step further and impersonate someone else by using photos from someone else\u0026rsquo;s public accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"scammer_instagram_profile.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of an instagram profile that is likely to be a scammer\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAn example of what a scammers Instagram account might look like.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey‚Äôll either then reach out to their victims or simply wait for their victims to contact them. When questioned how it all works, most of these scammers have a script filled with confusing jargon (talking without really saying anything as I like to call it) to make what they do sound more legitimate while claiming to be an expert, having screenshots of trading as proof (again, can be faked easily) and having ‚Äògood reviews‚Äô. These reviews they provide are fairly easy to fake - It just requires making a handful of additional social media accounts to send direct messages back and forth with and then taking screenshots of those conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommon words used in these types of messages include \u003ca href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1dpmdtw19x3n0/Mark-Yusko-Has-an-Imposter-We-Talked-to-Them\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eforex, bitcoin, trading\u003c/a\u003e, signals, and options along with the promise of a high or guaranteed return. Something to note about the last point is that investments of any type never guarantee any form of returns. The world\u0026rsquo;s best investor, Warren Buffet is unable to guarantee a return from their investments, it\u0026rsquo;s highly unlikely someone you found on Instagram can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese lengthy descriptions are used to confuse people who might not be as aware as to how investing, trading or cryptocurrency work. The main part that will lure them in is the high return of what they could make. Once the scammer has said enough to convince the victim, they‚Äôll ask them to make a bank transfer for as much as they can convince the victim to sent and as fast as they can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the first payment is sent, they have the victim fully hooked and will demand further payments for activation fees, management fees, transfer fees and so on until the victim realises that they fell for a scam. At this point, the victim will feel stuck and see the only way to get their money back is to send these further payments to \u0026lsquo;unlock\u0026rsquo; their profits or to start a refund. After these payments are made, the scammer simply blocks the victim and transfers the money away as fast as they can to avoid getting caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question now is who even falls for a scam like this? I like to visualise it as two groups of people; the first are those that are lured in by greed and the second are those that desperately need money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe former is self-explanatory. They are individuals hoping to make money quickly and do not understand or check how these returns are made or simply do not care. There is likely an element of naivety at play as well so they are just willing to trust someone they meet over social media. These individuals tend to learn the hard way that not everyone on the internet is their friend and wants to help them after unfortunately being scammed themself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe latter group make up the majority of those that end up getting scammed. Those in need of money tend to be on a lower income or are vulnerable in one form or another that which in turn can lead to financial vulnerability. The appeal of these scams to this group of people is the possibility that the opportunity presented to them could be legitimate and how the additional money can be of a great benefit with them. Hope is what the fraudsters will prey on with these types of victims and they won‚Äôt hesitate to take advantage of it. Scammers will frequently apply pressure to both groups of people to force their hand into sending them payments without really understanding the consequences of doing so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestment scams are normally advertised via social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook. TikTok and so on. Real investment firms and traders do not offer their services via direct messages on such platforms or on shady-looking websites. It\u0026rsquo;s best to always check if the firm or individual that you are speaking to is registered under the Financial Conduct Authority‚Äôs (FCA) register to check if the firm is regulated by the FCA and if there are any signs of such opportunities being a scam and if the investment opportunity is too good to be true then it often is. At the time of writing this post, I found that there is someone that recently \u003ca href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/10/26/gareth-gates-reveals-he-lost-250000-after-getting-burnt-with-investment-13483603/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003elost ¬£250,000 via one of these forex scammers\u003c/a\u003e üò¨\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I like to think of it is if someone could turn, for example, ¬£500 into ¬£5000, why do they need you? Surely if it was legitimate would this person not just put their own ¬£500 get ¬£5000 back out and then just repeat the process but this time with 10 lots of ¬£500 to make ¬£50,000 and so on? Why would they need your money or show you how to achieve this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"money-mules-\"\u003eMoney Mules üê¥\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third type of scam you‚Äôll come across are the ones where scammers promise a sum of money in exchange for using your bank account to send/receive some money. This is called money laundering - Fraudsters will want to move their money through these accounts to then send on to other accounts to conceal the money they obtained. This money can be associated with some severe crimes such as illegal fraud, human trafficking, corruption, kidnapping and even extortion. By helping they mule this money, you\u0026rsquo;re committing a crime.\nAgain, a similar approach is taken on social media to recruit people for this scam - Get in touch with victims, convince them to hand over their bank details, and then use them to launder the money or by telling the victim to withdraw the money as cash and then handing it over to the scammer while keeping a cut of the money themself. A key indication of people involved in money muling and looking to recruit others is the language they will use, often stating that the opportunity is a limited time offer and how the payout is fast, instant or risk-free. A money mule can lose access to financial services (such as bank accounts) and a convinced money mule could also serve up to 14 years in prison. This type of scam/fraud is targeted heavily at young people and university students.

It‚Äôs also important to never share your banking details such as your card details, online banking login information or card PIN with anyone or to make transactions or transfers when instructed by someone else in such situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat‚Äôs it for this issue. I hope I‚Äôve highlighted the importance of what to be aware of in these common scams and how you can avoid them. Scams of these nature can affect anyone including people you know. If you want to protect yourself and others from scams I recommend reading up more on the matter (you won\u0026rsquo;t have trouble finding articles online) and if you want to help your friends and family as well, consider forwarding this email to them as a starting point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ll see you all again, two weeks from now with another issue of Akash \u0026amp; Money üëã\u003c/p\u003e\n"

I also wanted to share my own experience where just last Friday, I managed to talk my own bill down to save an extra 25% in just a 20-minute phone call. I\u0026rsquo;m going to cover how I did this and how you can also haggle your own broadband bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-does-it-work\"\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently in the UK when you sign up with a broadband provider you\u0026rsquo;ll often come across two plans - pay monthly and a fixed-term contract. The monthly plan allows you to easily switch between providers when and where it suits you however this isn\u0026rsquo;t something a provider will want, so the monthly price for such plans are a lot higher than those on a fixed-term contract. Providers love long term customers and are willing to reduce the monthly cost if they can keep you for longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost contracts will have a minimum term of 12 months, however, longer contracts of 18 months and 24 months are also available for packaged bundles that include broadband, a landline line rental and a TV package as well. These contracts will often have a lower monthly fee for the duration of the contract and after the contract ends the price usually increases quite a bit. Knowing when your contract is coming to an end allows you to avoid getting stung with a higher bill by simply switching or asking your provider for a discount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also all comes down to the most important fact:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe cost of acquiring a new customer is often more than that the cost of keeping an existing customer happy.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvespcro found that it can \u003ca href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ecost up to five times more to attract a new customer than to keep a new one\u003c/a\u003e. In other words - It\u0026rsquo;s easier and cheaper for a service provider to give existing customers discounts and promotions to keep they a customer for longer, which is great news for you and gives you a chance to haggle with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"haggling-with-your-provider\"\u003eHaggling with your provider\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaggling might not be something you\u0026rsquo;re used to doing and can seem really un-British - After all, you\u0026rsquo;d never try to negotiate your weekly shopping bill at a supermarket. With internet providers, haggling can often net you a massive discount and it‚Äôs always worth giving it a try. The worst thing that can happen is that they say no. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of great advice online already that explains how you can do this. \u003ca href=\"https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/broadband-and-tv/haggle-your-broadband-existing-customer-tips/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eMoney Saving Expert offers 14 tricks\u003c/a\u003e you can use to slash your monthly bill and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjb7CZWHOF8\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eWhich UK has a YouTube video\u003c/a\u003e that shows some handy tips to consider before calling your provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"research--other-things-to-know\"\u003eResearch \u0026amp; other things to know\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore you contact your internet provider you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to have a battle plan ready.

Have these quotes at hand when contacting your existing provider as this will be your main bargaining chip. You can check directly with internet service providers and also using price comparison websites like \u003ca href=\"https://www.comparethemarket.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eCompare the Market\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.uswitch.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003euSwitch\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gocompare.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eGo Compare\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.moneysupermarket.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eMoneySuperMarket\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFind out when your existing contract ends - You\u0026rsquo;re going to have the most bargaining power towards the end of your contract as you have the freedom to switch away if you are not happy with your current provider. An internet provider will not want you to leave so they are more willing to offer discounts and price reductions at the end of your contact term.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eNote down how long you have been with your provider. You can often leverage your long term loyalty for a further discount. Phrases like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been a customer for X years and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that as a loyal customer you would be able to give me a better deal\u0026rdquo; can go a long way in swaying the provider to give you a discount.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t take the first deal that you are given. When you first contact your provider, the first team you will likely speak to is the customer service team. They are usually able to offer you an discount however this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the best deal they can provide you. The cancellations/retention team can offer you some of the better deals but you can\u0026rsquo;t really speak to them directly. Instead, you need to use a special phrase - \u0026ldquo;Thanks for the offer but I would still like to cancel my current service as I have found a better deal elsewhere\u0026rdquo;. This often leads to being put on hold and being transferred to another team. They\u0026rsquo;ll be aware of why you have been transferred to them and this will usually be the last chance they have to retain you as a customer and thus are more willing to offer a higher discount.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep a track of any service issues or outages you have experienced - You can mention how you were disappointed with these issues and how these effected you - Again, the aim of mentioning this is to try and get a further discount.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHear other people\u0026rsquo;s stories of how they haggled with their service providers. You can find these stories online to get a better understanding of what they did. Morgan M Woods explains how she \u003ca href=\"https://morganmwoods.com/save-money/haggle-with-sky/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ecut her own bill down with Sky and managed to save ¬£180\u003c/a\u003e and one blogger even \u003ca href=\"https://emmadrew.info/haggled-with-sky/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003emanaged to save almost ¬£500 in just an hour\u003c/a\u003e on a web chat with Sky!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBe prepared to leave! After all, if your provider is not willing to give you a discount, vote with your money and leave for the cheaper service with another provider. Sometimes your provider will call back with a better deal however if not, switching is not that much of a hassle as it was in the past and is always an option to consider to reduce your broadband bill.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmed with this knowledge you\u0026rsquo;ll find that navigating these types of conversations a lot easier. It\u0026rsquo;s important to remain polite but also firm when dealing with agents from your IPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"my-own-recent-experience--haggling-with-my-provider\"\u003eMy own recent experience  haggling with my provider\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called my IPS last week as my contact has just come to an end. My ¬£35 a month bill was going to increase to ¬£65 a month the next month and I personally just thought this was a lot higher than what I was able to get elsewhere. When I called my provider, the first thing I said was that I wanted to cancel my current subscription with them. This led to the agent immediately asking why and if it was because of the price which I confirmed. In the next minute, I was offered a reduced rate of ¬£42 a month. This price was still a lot more than what I was paying before so I persisted and said I still wanted to cancel as the price was just too high. I was then transferred to an agent in another department (likely the retention team) who mentioned they had been informed that I was looking to cancel and asked if there was any particular reason at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the moment I could mention everything I had researched. I mentioned the other deals from other providers that would be able to provide the same service for less than what I was currently paying and wanted to know if that could be matched or beaten as I would likely switch to the cheaper provider otherwise. A minute later I was offered a deal of ¬£34 a month - A saving of just ¬£12 a year compared to my just expiring contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point the agent also tried to scare me by saying switching would be a lot of hassle and that I might receive a lower speed with the new provider. I was aware that the other provider worked with \u003ca href=\"https://www.openreach.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eOpenreach\u003c/a\u003e and while on the phone I quickly searched my postcode on the Openreach website and found this not to be true and that I was able to get a much higher (but not required) speed if I choose to go with the other provider. I mentioned this and again stated that the quoted price was still more than what the new customer deal was from other providers for the same package (¬£30 a month). I decided to mention my recent issues and network outages that I had experienced with my current provider as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust 2 and a half weeks ago, my service suffered from a full day outage which prevented me from being able to work from home that day. I had previously called about this and asked what they could do about it and was told that I would be compensated but had still not heard back from them about this or seen this reflected in my monthly bill yet. The agent looked into this further for me and saw that a ticket had been raised but had not been looked into or approved by a manager yet. I asked how long it usually takes to look into such tickets and I was told that it usually took one week. It had been two weeks and a half since that ticket was raised and remained unresolved. I used this new information to my advantage as well and the agent then offered to have this ticket escalated but this would take an additional seven days to look into further - An extra two and a half weeks to the standard resolution timeframe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that taken into consideration, the agent was then able to offer a further reduced price of ¬£28.50 a month (on a 18-month contract) due to the inconveniences I had faced. This price was less than what I was able to find elsewhere for the same deal so I ended up accepting this new lower price. Compared to my last fixed price of ¬£35 a month, over the next 18 months at ¬£28.50, I\u0026rsquo;ll be saving an additional ¬£117!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I not called and mentioned wanting to cancel or switched, I would have been stuck with a higher bill of ¬£65 a month which would have cost me an extra ¬£540 over the next year and a half (from the contract price of ¬£35 a month). Instead, now I get to keep the same contract but for a lot less!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"till-next-time\"\u003eTill next time\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHopefully these tips and tricks should help you a bit more on your own broadband bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember to do your research to have a strong case ready to present to your internet provider and be prepared to switch if they are not willing to offer you a discount!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee you again in two weeks üëã\u003c/p\u003e\n"

        "content_html" : "\u003cp\u003eHey folks üëã\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the second issue of Akash \u0026amp; Money, fresh out the oven and delivered right to your inboxes!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast time I covered \u003ca href=\"/archive/akashandmoney/emergency-funds\" \u003eemergency funds\u003c/a\u003e and why you should probably have one. In this issue, I\u0026rsquo;ll be covering the basics of current accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"current-accounts\"\u003eCurrent Accounts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the UK your main bank account is your Current Account. This account is mainly used as a place you can store and withdraw money from and use the account to pay for things. You\u0026rsquo;ll find that it comes with a linked bank card called a debit card that lets you spend money from your account. This simply means that your account will have the money taken from the account either on the same day as a transaction or a few days after. Usually, you\u0026rsquo;ll have just the one card linked to each of your accounts but certain accounts can have more than one debit card linked to them at a time such as joint accounts and business accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn your debit card, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely also see a Visa or Mastercard logo on it that tells you which payment network your debit card runs on. Either is fine and there aren\u0026rsquo;t any major differences between the two in the UK. Using your card overseas is a slightly different story - I\u0026rsquo;d recommend that you have at least one Visa card and one Mastercard at hand as you might have payment issues using only one type of debit card in certain countries. While this is uncommon, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to have a few extra cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen using your card in the UK, there are no fees for making card transactions however international payments can cost you more based on the fees your bank charges - I\u0026rsquo;d recommend looking for an account/card that does not charge you any fees for using your card abroad like Monzo or Starling Bank. Just remember while spending on your card could be fee-free internationally, this might not be the case for international cash withdrawals. It\u0026rsquo;s always best to double-check with your card provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back at the accounts side of things, all current accounts also come with an account number that is 8 digits long and a 6 digits sort code. When paired together these give you a unique way of identifying your account at your bank. The first two digits of the sort code identify which bank the account number is linked to and the last 4 digits refer to a specific bank branch. For example, 23-05-80 is one of Metro Bank\u0026rsquo;s London based branches and can be \u003ca href=\"https://newseventsinsights.wearepay.uk/sort-code-checker/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003echecked here\u003c/a\u003e. For a branchless bank such as Starling Bank, as there are no branches all accounts share one sort code (60-83-71) instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"charges--fees\"\u003eCharges \u0026amp; Fees\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can be quite complex and could even be its own newsletter issue. I\u0026rsquo;ll try and keep this section as simple as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost standard current accounts and basic current accounts are free and there are no fees for opening and maintaining these accounts. Standard current accounts are suitable for most people, however, a bank may not offer if you do not qualify for one. This is where the basic account comes into play. It has most the same features but might have some restrictions on the account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third type of current account is called a package account and usually has a monthly fee. The main difference here is that these types of accounts come \u0026lsquo;packaged\u0026rsquo; with other benefits that can include travel insurance, mobile phone insurance, cashback/rewards and other benefits. I won\u0026rsquo;t explore the exact benefits you can get from these types of current accounts as there are several comparison websites that exist that allow you to compare between these types of accounts if you wanted to see which one suits you best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of these three, the standard account will likely be the account suitable for most people. I would only really recommend a packaged account for those that need all/most of the packaged benefits and if getting all those perks via the packaged account is cheaper than getting each of them separately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of this, there are often many other fees that exist with current accounts that you could be charged - Alway remember to check over the terms and conditions for any additional or hidden fees for certain transactions. For example, \u003ca href=\"https://www.barclays.co.uk/content/dam/documents/personal/current-accounts/barclays-tariff-for-personal-customers.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eBarclays charges a fixed 2.75% fee\u003c/a\u003e for each card payment made abroad and also add this fee on refunds (meaning you could be hit by the fee twice)!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe another fee you might come across is the overdraft fee or unauthorised overdraft fee. An overdraft is where you borrow money from the bank when you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough in your account to cover the cost of a transaction. Some banks even charge fees for declined transactions on your account such as failed direct debit payments! Again, the fees will depend on the bank so it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to check with your bank as you\u0026rsquo;ll want to make sure you aren\u0026rsquo;t paying any of these fees unnecessarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"direct-debits\"\u003eDirect Debits\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA direct debit is essentially an instruction from you to your bank to inform them that you are allowing a company to collect an amount of money from your account. You might already have a direct debit set up on your account for things like your monthly gym membership fee, your phone bill or a utility bill. Direct debits are set up using your account number and sort code and are not linked to your bank card (something I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some people get confused about). If you end up having to replace your bank card your direct debits remain unaffected as they do not use your card details at all and can still be collected from your account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirect debits will usually be for a fixed amount but can vary from time to time (e.g. using extra energy in the winter but using a lot less in the summer), and you\u0026rsquo;ll usually be told about these additional charges or payments before the payment is taken from your account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother great thing (and important fact) about direct debits is that it comes with something called the \u003ca href=\"https://www.directdebit.co.uk/DirectDebitExplained/Pages/DirectDebitGuarantee.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eDirect Debit Guarantee\u003c/a\u003e. This guarantee allows a payment to be reversed for a full and immediate refund if there is an error with the payment such as the payment being taken on the wrong date or if it\u0026rsquo;s for the wrong amount. Just remember, if you recall a payment that is not meant to be recalled, the organisation will look to recollect that payment - It\u0026rsquo;s best to always confirm with them what the payment is for before recalling it with your bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirect Debit payments are made via a system called Bacs (Bankers\u0026rsquo; Automated Clearing System). Founded in 1986, this is the system that clears payments on a three-day working cycle and is not only used for direct debit bills but also credits! You might not realise it but most salaries are paid via this system as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fscs\"\u003eFSCS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe FSCS (Financial Services Compensation Scheme) exists to help protect customers against financial services firms (like banks and credit card companies) that have failed/gone bust. It is important to check if your current account is protected by the FSCS. Almost all current accounts offer this protection in case the bank that you hold your money with goes out of business and this protection covers up to ¬£85,000 per provider you hold money with rather than per account. So if you have several accounts with a bank (such as savings and investment accounts), then only the first ¬£85,000 across all these accounts are covered. High street banks and digital banks should offer this protection as standard but remember to check. Revolut does not offer full FSCS as an example but still has something similar in place to keep their customer‚Äôs money safe in the chance that the business fails. You‚Äôll want to keep an eye out for a \u0026lsquo;fscs protected\u0026rsquo; symbol on their website and/or in their branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have more than ¬£85,000 then you might want to consider spreading your money across a few banks to make sure all your money is covered within that ¬£85,000 limit per provider. Just be aware that some banks might have a shared limit across other banks in their network (The ¬£85,000 FSCS protection from HSBC is shared with First Direct as First Direct is a division of HSBC UK).\nFor more information regarding the FSCS, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend going through \u003ca href=\"https://www.fscs.org.uk/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003etheir website\u003c/a\u003e as you can find a range of different financial products that they offer protection on (such as pensions, mortgages and insurance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"bank-transfers-faster-payments\"\u003eBank Transfers (Faster Payments)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent accounts will allow you to make bank transfers from your account to another account. This is usually via a system called a ‚ÄòFaster Payment‚Äô.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wearepay.uk/what-we-do/payment-systems/faster-payment-system/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eFaster Payments\u003c/a\u003e were officially launched 12 years ago! It\u0026rsquo;s this system that allows you to make bank transfers to your friends within seconds and the maximum that you can send at once is ¬£250,000. For anything more than that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to use a system called CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payment System) and you\u0026rsquo;ll have to speak to your bank to often make a CHAPS payment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make a bank transfer all you need is the other parties account number and sort code as well as their name. Most banks are now enrolled in a system called Confirmation of Payee that checks if the account you are sending money to matches the name you typed in for the transfer so you can check you are paying the right person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we have the benefits of this fast and easy to use system, it\u0026rsquo;s important to remember that these types of transfers are instant and do not offer any type of protection - If you are buying something it\u0026rsquo;s better to pay via your bank card. Fraudsters will often try to convince you to make payments via Faster Payments for this very reason. Once you send a bank transfer, it\u0026rsquo;s often impossible to get back as fraudsters will often move the money right away, making it hard to get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember to only make a bank transfer to someone you trust as it\u0026rsquo;s essentially the same as handing someone cash. I\u0026rsquo;ll be covering certain types of scams and how to avoid them in a later issue of this newsletter in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"standing-orders\"\u003eStanding Orders\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding Orders (or \u0026lsquo;Scheduled Payments\u0026rsquo;) is a way of setting up a fixed regular payment from your bank account to another account. You might set this up to move money from your current account to a savings account or to another current account. Standing orders are bank transfers, so they are also made via the Faster Payments system. The only difference is that they are automated transfers that you\u0026rsquo;ll have to set up ahead of time to be completed on a set date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"summary\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of parts to a current account but the above serves as a basic need to know and this knowledge should be handy regardless of the number of current accounts you have or even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a current account yet. I haven\u0026rsquo;t recommended any accounts here because I believe the best account will largely depend on the type of person you are and how you manage your money. There are a few websites that compare these types of accounts and a search online can often point out some benefits that some banks might be able to provide you. As always, remember to do your own research to find what works best for you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel free to forward this email to any of your friends and family that you think might be interested in knowing this, and remember to subscribe to the newsletter if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done that already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee you soon üëã\u003c/p\u003e\n"

For people already living paycheck to paycheck, the 80% paycheck offered simply was not enough and for others, they found themselves \u003ca href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53936926\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003elocked out from the furlough scheme completely\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are perfect examples of why everyone needs an emergency fund!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-an-emergency-fund\"\u003eWhat is an emergency fund?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn emergency fund is a separate stash of money for unexpected emergencies that may happen in life. Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s a few months of expenses which include rent/mortgage payments, petrol/car payments, food and utility bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere‚Äôs a lot of things that can be classed as an emergency; the loss of a job, an unexpected bill or even a boiler repair in the winter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emergency fund doesn‚Äôt only have one name. In other places, it has also been called the \u0026lsquo;F**k off\u0026rsquo; fund. \u003ca href=\"https://www.thebillfold.com/2016/01/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ePaulette Perhach wrote a post\u003c/a\u003e which explores two different situations, one without an emergency fund and another with one at hand. I think it is an article that is worth a read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0PdO9CY5Ew\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eI also managed to find this video that summarises emergency funds in just a minute\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"why-do-you-need-one\"\u003eWhy do you need one?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving an emergency fund can be helpful in several ways. A lot of the time without an emergency fund, people tend to look into credit cards, overdrafts and loans to help them in difficult situations. It‚Äôs great having access to such options. However, they can end up costing more in the long term due to the fees associated with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosing your only source of income can affect your financial life quite severely and sadly this was something that happened to a lot of people this year due to the ongoing pandemic. As mentioned above, a lot of people were able to get 80% of their salary via the furlough scheme in the UK with the remaining 20% being optionally provided by their employer. An emergency fund here could have been used to make up the difference instead if an employer did not provide this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself in a fortunate position where both my job and income were unaffected during the lockdown. At the moment I have about 6 months worth of expenses stored away for emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve had to dip into my emergency fund three times and I\u0026rsquo;ve listed what I used the money for each time below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVet bill - ¬£800\nMy dog ended up needing to visit the vet and receive emergency treatment. This is one of the largest bills I\u0026rsquo;ve had to pay out of pocket as I didn\u0026rsquo;t have pet insurance at the time. My emergency fund was at hand to cover the costs of this bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e24/7 locksmith - ¬£150\nSomehow I managed to lock myself (and my family) out the house with the keys still on the other side of the door late one night! After an hour of trying to unlock the door, I had to call a locksmith to drill a hole through the lock to get the door open and also have a new lock installed on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlight change fee - ¬£100\nTwo years ago I woke up one morning to catch my flight to Tokyo. Unfortunately, I managed to forget my passport at home with less than an hour before the flight. I ended up needing to rebook my flight for the next day. As I‚Äôd booked through a travel agent, I only needed to pay ¬£100 for a flight change and narrowly missed having to pay for a completely new ticket. At this point of my life, I didn‚Äôt have much of an emergency fund, but I\u0026rsquo;d often set money aside and end up dipping into this fund I had, which later became the foundation of my emergency fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of these situations, my emergency fund was available to cover these unexpected costs. Without this emergency fund, I would have likely turned to using my overdraft or a credit card for these purchases, with both of these options likely costing me more money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-start-an-emergency-fund\"\u003eHow to start an emergency fund\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t got one already, starting to save for an emergency fund can be daunting at first. There are a few things you can do that make the process a bit easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"1-start-small--figure-out-how-much-you-need-per-month\"\u003e1. Start small \u0026amp; figure out how much you need per month\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to look back and work out how much you spend each month to get a rough idea of how much you need per month. To start with it\u0026rsquo;s best to aim for ¬£1,000 as the starting point of your fund. Once you hit that goal, continue adding to your fund until you have several months of expenses put away. I\u0026rsquo;ve found having 6-9 months worth of expenses is generally a good amount to have in an emergency fund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"2-put-money-aside-right-after-you-get-paid\"\u003e2. Put money aside right after you get paid\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI treat saving for my emergency fund like a bill. I always have to pay into it first after getting paid. By putting this money away first, I‚Äôm less tempted to spend it and adopted an \u0026lsquo;Out of sight, out of mind\u0026rsquo; mentality with it, which leads me to the next point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"3-put-your-emergency-fund-in-a-separate-account\"\u003e3. Put your emergency fund in a separate account\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found that keeping this money in a separate place from my main savings has helped remind me not to dip into this fund apart from when I needed it. You can do this as well by using a separate savings account or using a bank that offers the ability to split your money into several pots/spaces without the use of multiple bank accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"4-using-savings-apps--round-ups\"\u003e4. Using savings apps \u0026amp; round-ups\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSavings apps like \u003ca href=\"https://withplum.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003ePlum\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.meetcleo.com/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eCleo\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.tandem.co.uk/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" \u003eTandem\u003c/a\u003e all make it a little easier to save money by putting away small amounts of money throughout the month.
